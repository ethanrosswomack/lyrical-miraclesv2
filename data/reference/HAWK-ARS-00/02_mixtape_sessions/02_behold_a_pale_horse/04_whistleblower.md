> **Lyrics — Web Format**  
>
> I just want to give a special shout out to the Snowdens, the Assanges, the Mannings of  
> Our present age, the others out there, the whistleblowers, fighting the good fight  
> This song is for you, and I encourage each and every one of you in a position to do something  
> To actually do something  
>
> Yo, yo, it's official, my detrimental blowing whistle keeps exposing foes, I hope you listen  
> Cause my vision's so focused, this whole system's about to fold, who knows, I might go to prison  
> Just like Manning, I'll show them what they've been missing, and make them take a break from fakes  
> Cause I create resistance, you're too late, but I'd hate for you to take position, just to have me  
>
> Shake your faith, I forgot to mention, my shooter never misses, every line that I've written, was  
> Placed with grace, I play these tapes, and leave you wishing, your enemy wasn't me, cause I am so  
> Persistent, that your team starts to scream as I make incisions, my decisions leave them fiending  
> For ways to distance themselves from me, but no relief, for these little bitches, my instrumental  
>
> Sentence stings, you are bearing witness, to the truth of what it means, to be scared shitless  
> There's no repentance, you're defenseless, I'm relentless, and I'm exposing the game, all appearances  
> Are fearless, this is really just insane, and all seriousness, do you think I'm playing, when I say  
> That you're inferior, delirious, and crazed, all I've really got to do, is show these people, all this  
>
> Evil, then you're steeper, will this be, well nothing to hide behind, the sequel to this story will  
> Include, all the gory details, you never thought they'd find, so if you see something, say something, speak  
> Up, fuck these motherfuckers, fucking the whole goddamn world, they're gonna run a smear campaign  
> Everybody gonna forget, what it was you exposed, but do the shit anyways man, somebody's got to  
>
> Somebody's got to fucking take the lead, yeah, so blow the whistle, make it official, just like Cooper  
> Take the troops, and set them loose, with your mind, mental evidence, and paint the perfect picture  
> Just like your heaven sin, I never meant for you to get injured, conscript malicious, oh so vicious  
> And then make these bitches listen, I'm capricious, with this hit list, everyone is left defenseless  
>
> All my interests are relentless, so I never get to witness, how this business shit gets, I'm too busy  
> Writing sentences, to make them back down, one by one, yeah, it's a fact now, we've all got guns  
> And you never know how, it'll play out son, but have your army just quit, this is fun, this shit's  
> Infectious, my selection of defectors, is impeccable, detectives who'd reject you by  
>
> Consensus, is a spectacle, suspected they'd dissect you best, imperfect my exceptional  
> Misdirection, so you're less effective, it's regrettable, but if you thought you stood a chance  
> You never did, do not advance, my stance is that this romance between us, left you in a trance  
> I took your power, all you built is now mine, you fucking cowards, if you think I'm bluffing  
>
> You've got nothing, so tell me how are you, gonna keep your secrets, no one swears allegiance  
> I think you demons shouldn't speak, you're too weak to keep breathing, all you puppets should  
> Be silent, don't make me turn to violence, there's a room for non-compliance, everybody stay quiet  
> So after the smear campaign, and everybody hates your name, and you're labeled as a terrorist  
>
> Stick to your truth, man, people are listening, they just ain't brave enough yet

> **EverLight’s Rite**  
> *Lyrical Dissection & Commentary*  
> Track: **Whistleblower** — *Behold A Pale Horse 2020*  
>   
> **Resistance Manifesto** — This is the album’s clearest salute to whistleblowers-as-warriors. Snowden, Assange, and Manning are name-checked to open the track, setting the stage for a **first-person battle cry** of lyrical exposure.  
>   
> **No Mercy Flow** — The rhyme chains here are hostile and unrelenting—Hawk Eye turns his mic into a weaponized subpoena. The bars are more like charges filed in rhythm.  
>   
> **Symbolism Overdrive** — “Blowing whistle,” “consensus,” “classified,” “defectors,” “non-compliance” — the semantic field is pure intel warfare. Think Edward Snowden rapping a declassified drop over a war drum.  
>   
> **Narrative Position** — Track 4 solidifies the *militant testimony* phase of the album. If “William Cooper” framed the problem, and “Kamikaze” screamed defiance, “Whistleblower” starts issuing indictments.  
>   
> **Suggested Visuals / Links**  
> • Mashup visuals of leaked docs flying through static TV channels  
> • Typographic overlay: “See Something? Say Something.”  
> • Bonus Link: *The Modern Martyrs: Snowden, Manning, Assange ➝*
