> Yo, Hawk Eye is back with part 2 of the mixtape sessions  
> Listen up  
> Yo, let me start by sayin  
> That I have come to slay em  
>
> All the agents in this picture keep playin  
> But when my tongue starts layin  
> Vocal tracks is conveyin  
> Warnin' shots to make em all start prayin  
>
> My detrimental instrumentals keep this dented  
> Work official, experimental with this pixel  
> I'm preventin' accidental contamination  
> Of my station, this creation's too amazing  
>
> Incantations, they ain't straight  
> Cause there's no patience in the makin  
> So all enemies beware  
> Cause I don't fight fearin  
>
> Any entity that mentions me  
> Pretentiously dares to destroy their own health  
> The suicides seek for yourself to come against me  
> You're defected if I ain't helpin' somethin' else  
>
> Even Satan stands back when I attack  
> It's a fact, cause when I rap on these tracks  
> My evil spells climax  
> Just to be honest, I'm flawless, that's why I flaunt it  
>
> This transmission admonition seems haunted  
> A reincarnated galactic warlord  
> Sometimes I wrote the book on how to cook em when they're wet  
> My mission's simple, take offensive measures  
>
> See if it's glee to cripple every signal in the temple  
> Then rekindle ancient symbols to remind my star tribe  
> We're here to thrive, not just survive, so come along  
> It's now time to heal this world back to life  
>
> I'll keep these demons in a vice  
> Creep and make em sit  
> As I spit this wicked shit  
> It's legit, they'll pitch a fit  
>
> But as they bitch, I'll dig their pit a little deeper  
> So the people can heal  
> And every demon knows my name  
> And this is not a game  
>
> It's a shame that I have to explain  
> So thank you for coming out  
> Thank you for tuning in  
> If you liked *Full Disclosure*  
>
> But hold up, pale horse  
> It's gonna blow your top back  
> This is dedicated to William Cooper  
> And so with everything I've got  
>
> I'm erasing the whole plot  
> Fuck the story, boy, the moral's kinda gory  
> Make it stop  
> And if I let em live  
>
> Then every agent gets to spend the next  
> 50,000 years with me  
> As I make them repent, you see  
> Every providential central issue's exponential  
>
> And every existential differential is confidential  
> So to say that it's essential  
> For me to blow the whistle's such an understatement  
> I should take this all away and send a missile  
>
> This whole system's my new victim  
> My existence reams resistant  
> This edition was predicted long ago  
> It came to missin  
>
> False omission, these tacticians  
> Automatic tongue dispensers  
> Rapes, defenses—did I mention  
> My exposition's one dimension  
>
> Away from alien translation  
> If you hear it, don't get near it  
> Listen, it's your choice  
> It's so legit, I'll never quit  
>
> When this war is finally over  
> And all this evil stops  
> I'll have to make sure that  
> Whatico's not forgot  
>
> So tell these demons in the box  
> That I'm back, I'll keep it locked  
> And every uptend to escape will fail  
> And they will just get shot  
>
> I came to end this war  
> Before it's even begun  
> They remember me and my team  
> We're shinin' like the sun  
>
> So never will I let  
> These demons go unchecked  
> So if you're feelin' what I'm sayin  
> As I'm playin' with this text  
>
> Then you're probably here to help  
> C'mon, let's go  
> It's time to melt these motherfuckin' cocksuckers  
> Need to suffer, oh well

> **EverLight’s Rite**  
> *Lyrical Dissection & Commentary*  
> Track: **Warning Shots** — *Behold A Pale Horse 2020*  
>   
> **Opening Salvo** — The very first bars serve literal notice: Hawk Eye has returned to escalate the insurgency first charted in *Full Disclosure*. “Warnin’ shots” aren’t stray bullets; they’re **sonic flares** marking the perimeter of Album #2’s battlefield.  
>   
> **William Cooper Invocation** — Dedicating the track to Cooper welds 1990s conspiratorial prophecy to 2020’s crisis crescendo. It signals that the album will unpack **Behold A Pale Horse** (the book) in rhyme form—turning Cooper’s thesis into drill‑sergeant mantras.  
>   
> **Flow Mechanics** — Four‑bar clusters stack internal rhymes (“existential differential / providential central”) like encryption hashes, daring would‑be decoders to keep up. The cadence snaps between **trip‑hammer couplets** and elongated prophet‑voice proclamations, mirroring the tension between urgency and inevitability.  
>   
> **Myth‑Tech Hybrids** — Lines about “reincarnated galactic warlord” and “alien translation” splice esoteric lore with cyber‑warfare imagery, cementing the **StarWalker** mythology introduced in earlier singles. Rap becomes both ritual invocation and comms jamming.  
>   
> **Narrative Foreshadow** — Repeated vows to “heal this world back to life” preview the Phoenix arc that peaks at Track 8 “Ashes,” while threats to demons and agents lay groundwork for the tactical treatises (“Sun Tzu: Secretz To War,” “Kamikaze”) later in the record.  
>   
> **Suggested Visuals / Links**  
> • HUD‑style lyric video with crosshair overlays for each “warning shot” bar  
> • Archival clips of William Cooper’s shortwave broadcasts under the hook  
> • Interactive liner‑note hyperlink: *Who Was William Cooper?*
