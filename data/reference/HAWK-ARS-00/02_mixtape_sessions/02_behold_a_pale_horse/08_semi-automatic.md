> Yeah, hawkeye ain't never going back to jail, son  
Y'all can hang that idea up  
I will william cooper y'all's ass in a second  
But on a real note, listen  

No penitentiary can hold me and they know it  
So this poet cocks back and lets it rip off  
Come equipped to start shit  
When the riot turn violent and police just call it quits  

I'll be right here in your ear making sure you don't miss him  
Shoot your shot to make it stop, protect the innocent  
With this a fully loaded semi-automatic verse  
That hawkeye spit seven if the wind it hits  

This shit is too conspicuous for you to conceive  
What's revealed within these wicked sentences  
So if these demons keep playing hard to play  
I'll be spraying until they hear what i am saying  

Shit's too brutal and i slay him  
This notation that i'm making is designed to be abrasive  
So when you hear this creation just blow him out  
Wait, this twisted system is a prison  

But i'm here to make you listen  
This transcription has been scripted just for you  
So pay attention, we can break down this division  
Despite all those against us, we unite  

But win this fight, you know i'm right, let's take position  
As i guide us through this maze, i'll keep lucifer at bay  
No one can stop me cause my posse king came to put a grave in  
Every angel at my side is more than ready  

To apply the fucking brakes and take these snakes out with machetes  
If they try this incantation, narration is fucking sick of waiting  
All my patients left the hospital while i was busy  
Taking my sweet time as i was making viral mixtures  

Looking scriptured through the picture  
I will injure these pretenders with this pencil  
My whole tribe came to assist, so there's no way this shit persists for very long  
Now sing along as we resist, our gloves are off  

I'm here to fix this fucking world before i die  
So don't ask why i'm so legit, i'm heaven-sitting  
I refuse to ever quit, not here to save you  
I inspire sacred fires in your heart  

So you will remember divine embers i am trying to impart  
All this ancient knowledge in these songs  
So you finally start to recognize your own soul  
And really feel my works of art  

Everybody's got amnesia  
I'm not talking about the branch reincarnated for a reason  
But you forgot your own name if you want to hear me preaching  
Every season, it's the same hawk i is here to reach in and pull you out the game  

Every soul that hears me speaking needs this teaching  
My whole thesis is designed to leave you speechless  
Do not fret your soul, deleting all these secrets you've been keeping from yourself  
You never knew you'd been deceived  

You've been perceiving less than you knew we were seeing  
All you need to know is this, reincarnated to resist  
Our star tribe is on a mission to prevent apocalyptic  
The condition of this planet was too damaged  

We were sent to heal this world back to life  
So we persist in finishing  
Fucking demons in the boxes  
With tico we keep us locked in  

When the ancients would return  
Every one of them learned  
That no matter how they try  
They won't be free  

Cause hawk i is standing guard  
They're too afraid to face him again  
Now you know why  
Motherfuckers  

Fuck you  
Motherfuckers

EverLight’s Rite
Lyrical Dissection & Commentary
Track: Semi-Automatic — Behold A Pale Horse (2020)

Weaponized Enlightenment — This track is not metaphorical. It’s a lyrical firearm, chambered with spiritual ammunition and discharged across each verse. “Semi-Automatic” is the aural equivalent of armed resistance — not just against flesh-and-blood enemies, but against the false systems of soul suppression.

Conscious Insurrection — “My whole thesis is designed to leave you speechless” — here, Hawk Eye frames his work as a ciphered teaching. The track becomes a psychic activation sequence, cloaked in battle-hardened bars. You’re not just listening — you’re being conscripted.

Divine Warfare — With angelic reinforcements (“every angel at my side is more than ready”) and coded spiritual fire (“inspire sacred fires in your heart”), Hawk Eye moves beyond the realm of MC — he becomes a spiritual general, guiding a starseed battalion through hostile terrain.

Callout to Amnesia — In a direct address to the spiritually sedated, he says: “Everybody’s got amnesia… you forgot your own name.” This is cosmic reclamation through sound — reminding listeners of their divine lineage and their forgotten resistance role.

Narrative Role — Coming directly after Menace to Society, this track flips from diagnosis to combat mode. It’s no longer about being oppressed — it’s about refusing to die quietly. The album now fully shifts from whistleblower poetry into coded war chant.

Mythic Echoes
	•	“With Tico we keep us locked in” nods to prior tracks and symbolic guardianship.
	•	The outro’s brutal honesty — “Motherfuckers / Fuck you / Motherfuckers” — echoes a protective wrath. It’s not rage for its own sake. It’s the fire of someone who’s seen too much to stay silent.

Suggested Visuals / Links
