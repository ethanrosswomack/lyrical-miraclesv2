> **Lyrics — Web Format**  
>
> This music is an attack on the system, the matrix  
> I'm here to destroy it  
> Like Neo, I incarnated on purpose  
> And check it  
>
> Yo, pen and paper's all I need to rape this whole scene  
> I'ma die for this shit, but first I gotta make em bleed  
> So when this soul vibe hits, you'll all know what it means  
> Cause I ain't explainin' shit, you better follow while I lead  
>
> I keep on preachin' for no reason  
> Everybody's plottin' treason, but I still reachin' when I'm teachin'  
> Cause I'm not applying seasoning, raw truth's in this booth  
> No sugarcoats for your tooth, so tell the youth to get used to this abuse  
>
> There's no excuse,  
> This fuckin' matrix better panic  
> Cause I planned this, goddammit, I infiltrated like a bandit  
> Now I'm here and they stand it — they keep arresting me  
> To test and see if they can get the best of me  
>
> Molesting me with questionings to make me second guess my scheme  
> But every move I make is calculated, no mistakes, there's no debate  
> Why hesitate to break these snakes I fuckin' hate  
> The way this world is run by pedophiles  
>
> And everyone's too juvenile to take these fuckers out  
> But I'm about to turn this dial up a little bit  
> You hear this shit, it's venomous  
> My fuckin' music makes them lose it, it's so fluidly intent  
>
> On exposing all opponents I leave them hopeless  
> When I spit, blow this whistle, it's official  
> I am here till you repent, you goddamn demons  
> Better run with this gun, I'm havin' fun  
>
> All you politicians need to listen, I am not the one  
> So if I mention your position, just know your time is done  
> So keep on wishin', but this transmission has just begun  
>
> Yeah, what the fuck y'all gon' do now  
> Hawkeye is on your ass  
> Y'all ain't notice the world went crazy since my music came out  
>
> Yo, and everybody's gonna know what you tried to hide  
> And every lie that you told, nope, we won't let it slide  
>
> I know you had high hopes, but the people will decide  
> Oh, I see them tying ropes off the steeple, time to die  
>
> Inciting riots  
> I'm the pilot and my kamikaze game is inspired by the violence done to others in your name  
> So if you think that you can silence me, then I am takin' aim at Goliath  
>
> My alliance will kill him all the same  
> Chemtrails in the sky, the water's laced with fluoride  
> And everybody's fuckin' trapped, makin' money till they die  
> They inject the poison at birth to make sure your third eye never opens  
>
> Keep you broken so that you never try  
> But there's a few  
> Holdin' true, fuckin' soldiers in this coup  
> Showin' you what the news channel tries to hide from view  
>
> Cause if you knew who was who, here's what the government would do  
> They'd round you up in FEMA camps and fill them coffins with your crew  
>
> William Cooper is now dead  
> Them stormtroopers took his head  
> And everyone who read his book should take a look at what he said  
>
> There's not too many heroes left, but I'ma be here with the rest  
> Reincarnated to resist, I'll make the devil insist that I relent  
> But this advent was meant to leave the system bent  
>
> So when I'm murdered these absurd words will keep observers penitent  
> When I'm gone, the world will say a true legend died today  
>
> If we keep persistin', then this twisted system is gonna cave…  
>
> Full disclosure came out  
> COVID-19 shut the world down  
> Everybody started fuckin' riotin'  
>
> The fuck is happenin' next, y'all?  
> I'll tell you what's happenin' next  
> This twisted system is going to cave  
> That's the whole reason for my existence  
>
> To change this shit  
> And to protect the Earth from these fuckin' parasites  
> Go back and listen to Full Disclosure  
> And then start this whole tape over again  
>
> Listen to the whole story  
> Oh, and when that third tape drops  
> It's over, game changed  
> ```
