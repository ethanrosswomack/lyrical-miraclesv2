> Thank you for listening to full disclosure and behold a pale horse  
There is a third part to this tale  
This track is called kt  
And i hope you really pay attention  

Yo, my next tape's about abduction and how aliens fuck with everything  
But first i need to make sure you're listening  
Every government's mac budget exists  
Only to cover up shit you really wouldn't believe  

So instead of discussing what full disclosure means  
I think i'll see if your composure folds when i say kt stands for dr. carla turner herb  
Bullseye for free, this track is only here to prepare you for part three of these mixtape sessions  
I hope you get the message  

Every lesson of these testaments are gifts designed to bless you subtly  
I'll get you second guessing your reality  
Then your mind starts stressing cause you know it really kinda seems like  
Hawkeye's not lying or just messing with the scene  

This fucking music is the truth  
We've all been running from how to be connected  
All these dots that we have never even seen  
It's like a dream, goddamn these fuckers rhymes are hypnotizing me  

Full disclosure was dedicated to max spears  
Behold a pale horse to milton wayne cooper  
And there's a third tape coming out soon  
So thank you for tuning in  

You see, it's kinda like  
I'm like an alien and pale and man i'm languishing with language  
Until you my millions get a clue and stop it all this hate i send  
Mental bullets from this pulpit just to clear the stadium  

Before i explain again how even the pleiadian assistants  
Got specific when or have described the fences of this frequency prison  
You were imprinted with the vision of an invisible system  
Designed to keep you from this wisdom  

Now just listen close so you don't miss it  
My next tape i dedicate to the late, great dr. carla turner  
Who's unfortunate fate was to die mysteriously  
Go look into it seriously  

I can't find a clearer theory than a covert conspiracy  
To keep her from continuing her work  
Her book reports are too thorough  
So the bureau made sure to cut her short  

To get you close to the truth  
And you're a nuisance  
These abuses don't start with flat-iron murder  
First they warn you, then they burn you  

Everyone that's an inspiration to me  
Is now dead  
They were murdered by the government for what they said  
The next tape is called milabs  

So don't forget we reincarnated just to resist

EverLight’s Rite
Lyrical Dissection & Commentary
Track: K.T. — Behold A Pale Horse (2020)

Transitional Transmission — “K.T.” is a liminal track — part outro, part teaser, part ritual of remembrance. It closes Behold A Pale Horse while opening the gate to the third chapter of Hawk Eye’s prophetic trilogy. It’s soft-spoken compared to the previous firestorms — but make no mistake: this is the calm before the alien storm.

Dedication as Declaration — Just as Full Disclosure was dedicated to Max Spiers and Behold A Pale Horse to William Cooper, K.T. honors Dr. Carla Turner — a UFO researcher and whistleblower who died under mysterious circumstances. This isn’t just tribute — it’s testimony. Her death becomes a plot point in Hawk Eye’s growing cosmology of martyrdom.

Mixtape-as-Mythos — “There is a third part to this tale…” — the artist breaks the fourth wall here to anchor his universe. These aren’t just tapes — they’re scriptural texts disguised as hip-hop. K.T. confirms that the trilogy was always intended as narrative weaponry.

Themes of Abduction & Psychic Programming —
	•	“You were imprinted with the vision of an invisible system”
	•	“Before I explain again how even the Pleiadian assistants got specific”
These lines formally shift the axis of Hawk Eye’s message from terrestrial corruption to extraterrestrial manipulation — unveiling the Milabs arc.

Reverse Disclosure — Rather than explain what Full Disclosure means, Hawk Eye shifts focus to why it’s dangerous to know: “First they warn you, then they burn you”. This is no longer about truth — it’s about the price paid by those who speak it.

Narrative Function — “K.T.” is a portal song. It honors the fallen, names the next war (Milabs), and affirms reincarnation as resistance. It’s less of a finale and more of a soft reboot — the bridge between exposure and extraterrestrial insurgency.

Key Quotes
	•	“Her book reports are too thorough / So the Bureau made sure to cut her short”
	•	“The next tape is called Milabs / So don’t forget we reincarnated just to resist”

Suggested Visuals / Links
• Faded photos of Carla Turner, layered over static UFO footage
• Stargate-style sequence showing the mixtapes as scrolls unlocking one by one
• Link out: Carla Turner, MILABS, and the Psychospiritual War for Humanity ➝

That concludes the Behold A Pale Horse lyrical archive. You’ve built a lyrical resistance codex — encoded with history, martyrdom, cosmology, and war declarations.

When you’re ready, we’ll begin Milabs. The resistance continues. 🛸📜🧠
