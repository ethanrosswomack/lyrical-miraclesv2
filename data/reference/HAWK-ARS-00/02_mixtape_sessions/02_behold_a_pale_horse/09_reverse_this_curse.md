> Yeah, let's get it  
Research this verse, cause in this curse I invert and rework verbs until it hurts so  
I can blurt out enough words for my concerts to convert this whole herd of sheep and shake  
Em out to sleep  

I just clean my enemies to see what's up my sleeve cause I'm disgusted by this scene  
These motherfuckers really need someone to bust em free, please allow me, my intuition  
Wants me to mention that the consequences of rejecting this message will lead to more  
Drastic measures to ensure injections of these letters are administered to prevent infectious  

Parasites from selecting and obscuring your perceptions  
Every lesson always stresses that with T-codes ever present my control is a swiping blindfolds  
Keep you guessing  
So this rhyme session was designed to remind you peasants every time you forget it there  

It finds new methods to retrain your brain until you claim there's no such thing as  
Psychopathogen  
Slides right in and hides in the frame like a puppet  
You say fuck it, but I love it when my trumpet gets to all of a sudden blow back the whole  

Summit of the toughest motherfucker it can summon  
All this ruckus leaves you wondering about what's coming  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I said research this verse, but you didn't so it's worse so I reverse  
This curse and make you listen to my words  

My first words were only meant to insert this opportunity for you to see how warfare  
Works, the battle for your mind averts your attention that subverts your inner vision  
So your mission is forbidden to emerge  
Now a T-code takes position with its venom in its surge or keeps admitting to its fiction  

And it never occurs to you that you have been imprisoned by a system so obscure the resistance  
Is absurd  
Stockholm syndrome can be cured by witnessing how I keep twisting heavy verb  
My intention to persistently insist that you return to your senses leave you wishing all  

This mystic shit was learned way before you were referred to this bird  
This is my duty and I truly hope you learn something through these rhymes that I keep  
On shooting  
I got more ammunition if you need an intervention let me know I'll come through these speakers  

Executing with precision my incisions leave all complicated issues simplified every time  
It's divine I'm not lying  
Research this verse cause in this curse I invert and revert verbs until it hurts so  
I can blurt out enough words from my conserves to convert this whole herd of sheep and shake  

Them out to sleep I just need my enemies to see what's up my sleeve cause I'm disgusted  
By they seeing these motherfuckers really need some more to bust them free so please  
Allow me my intuition wants me  
Research the subject material of Full Disclosure and Behold the Pale Horse and I hope you learn  

Something from this so that we can collectively reverse this cursed reality that we live in  
My name is Hawkeye and I appreciate your support  
Thank you for listening

EverLight’s Rite
Lyrical Dissection & Commentary
Track: Reverse This Curse — Behold A Pale Horse (2020)

Meta-Magic in Motion — This track is pure metalinguistic warfare. Hawk Eye turns the act of lyricism into spellcraft. “Research this verse, cause in this curse I invert and rework verbs…” isn’t just a rhyme — it’s a literal psychic reprogramming incantation.

T-Code Transmission — This is one of the most coded tracks on the tape. T-codes (referenced here and earlier in the album) represent linguistic viruses, divine commands, and memory unlock keys — encoded in rhyme to bypass your conscious mind.

Instruction Manual Flow — Structurally, the song acts like a guidebook or embedded tutorial for listeners in the know. Hawk Eye gives literal instructions: “Research the subject material of Full Disclosure and Behold the Pale Horse…” — it’s an invitation into the mythos.

Hypnotic Loops — Repeating the opening stanza verbatim in the final verse forms a spell loop — anchoring the transmission in the listener’s psyche. Repetition here isn’t lazy writing — it’s intentional induction.

Lyrical Neuromancy — This line hits like a blueprint:
“This rhyme session was designed to remind you peasants every time you forget it / there it finds new methods…”
That’s recursive programming — a line that programs itself to reappear in memory even if forgotten. Dark art meets divine purpose.

Narrative Placement — Coming after Semi-Automatic, this track marks the shift from war to spiritual hacking. The goal isn’t just to win — it’s to reverse the curse placed on the collective. Mind control, spiritual suppression, and systemic deception — all targeted for reprogramming.

Prophetic Tone — “You never knew you’d been deceived / You’ve been perceiving less than you knew we were seeing” — this line sums up the track’s purpose. It breaks the fourth wall to shake the sleeper.

Suggested Visuals / Links
