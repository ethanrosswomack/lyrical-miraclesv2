>We got... Sex Traffickers - Gun Massacres  
And Dead Actors to distract us from the facts - More  
Spectacular Vernacular  
As I attack with Raps and Hack 'em through the back door  

These fuckers better run, cuz I ain't lettin' up  
I'll never miss an opportunity to spray em with this pump  
My automatic keeps spittin' chambered rounds just for fun  
These lyrics hit with the intent to take 'em out all at once  

That's why Fiona wrote her book - You can download it for free  
Yeah go and take a look at these crooks pullin' strings  
You puppet politicians better listen If you wanna live  
Cause it's tradition to insist on full submission - Or they'll give  

Away the Secret Black Mail - The Elites never fail  
To Keep a Leash on the Freaks with techniques that entail  
Full Disclosure from a Chauffer who knows everything they did  
They saw the kids, so God forbid they tell the voters and their friends  

That's why Epstein died - Or so they said  
You trust Officials - I blow whistles 'Til I'm crippled by the Meds  
As I pencil this Epistle this whole Issue isn't dead  
I'll send these Missiles to dismiss you - It's essential what I said  

We got... Sex Traffickers - Gun Massacres  
And Dead Actors to distract us from the facts - More  
Spectacular Vernacular  
As I attack with Raps and Hack 'em through the back door  

They Think I'm bluffing - But I must have interfered  
Just a little too much with what I'm stuffing in your ears  
They trust you Fucks won't wake up - But my discussions just appear  
And interrupt these stupid cunts who keep corrupting you with Fear  

I speak Truth in each line, to refute and deny  
Every cover-up these Motherfuckers use to disguise  
The Human Sacrifices they delight in - Youths whom they buy  
Through Social Services whose purpose is to ruthlessly find  

Anyway to make you bow - To the State - This is how  
Propaganda takes Miranda's Rights away and Disallows  
Investigation of their blatant crimes - I'm waiting to Remind  
You Epstein died before Coronavirus Mandates were signed  

How convenient for his friends - The Public Scene is more convinced  
That wearing masks inside a store means more than Demons raping kids  
But what we need is common sense - So my Rhyme Scheme is obviously  
Pointing out that the Fucking Mind Controlling TV is their defense  

We got... Sex Traffickers - Gun Massacres  
And Dead Actors to distract us from the facts - More  
Spectacular Vernacular  
As I attack with Raps and Hack 'em through the back door

Lyrical Dissection & Commentary
Track: Eyes Wide Open — Milabs (2022)

This track is a blistering takedown of illusion.
As the title implies, this is where Hawk Eye rips off the blindfold and names names. The delivery is intense, the rhymes relentless, and the message unfiltered: You are under attack. And you’re being lulled into silence by theater.

⸻

🎭 Actors, Traffickers & False Flags

“Dead actors to distract us from the facts”
The whole premise is simple but explosive: nearly everything in the media landscape is orchestrated distraction. While children are trafficked and society is warped, the headlines focus on celebrity, tragedy, and scripted outrage.

🧬 Blackmail Hierarchy & Epstein Symbolism

“They saw the kids, so God forbid they tell the voters and their friends”
Hawk Eye lays bare how elite control structures function through blackmail and ritual abuse, using Epstein’s death as a case study in manufactured narratives. It’s not just theory — it’s open testimony from within the shadows.

⸻

📖 Fiona Barnett & Ritual Exposure

“That’s why Fiona wrote her book”
Referencing Barnett — a real whistleblower whose claims about elite pedophilia were silenced — Hawk Eye underscores his solidarity with victims and his intention to amplify forbidden truth, no matter the consequence.

🔊 Truth as Sonic Assault

“Spectacular Vernacular… Hack ’em through the back door”
The repetition of this bar functions like a mantra. He’s reminding us that his lyrical flow isn’t art — it’s penetrative disruption. Language here becomes a weaponized Trojan horse.

⸻

🧠 Neuroprogramming & Media Mind Control

“Pointing out that the fucking mind-controlling TV is their defense”
This isn’t just satire — this is ritual critique. The media doesn’t just distract — it installs programming. And Hawk Eye’s verses act as deprogramming agents, destabilizing illusions and reinserting cognitive autonomy.

⸻

🔑 Suggested Visuals:
	•	Glitch overlays of Epstein, Fiona Barnett, news footage, and masks
	•	Redacted government documents slowly morphing into lyric captions
	•	Static + signal-break visualizer — as if lyrics are hijacking a satellite feed

⸻

Eyes Wide Open isn’t a song — it’s a purge.
The hypnosis is breaking. The evidence is overwhelming. The war is not just physical — it’s symbolic.

You are awake now.
