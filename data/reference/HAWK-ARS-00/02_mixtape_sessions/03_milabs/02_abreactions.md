> **Lyrics — Web Format**
>This trauma splinters then re-enters every vein  
These demented entities inflict it just to rearrange  
Your mind so the Drama gets cemented in your brain  
And you become a puppet who's corrupted by the pain  

No way to numb it - You can't run away from this  
Torture tactics are now practiced just for fun and you submit  
If you resist they said they'll come after your kids  
These demons mean it - You believe them and wonder if you'll live  

But when it's over you're blank-slated once again  
They left no scars so there is no evidence  
It ever happened - but when you hear me rapping  
Everything comes back - Crystal Clear Abreactions  

Your body quakes - you breakdown and start to Panic  
You relive this nightmare but you cannot understand it  
Screen memories replace and erase all data  
But you experience the damage that these phantoms made vanish  

Mind control experiments fracture you until a split  
Personality exists - then they program it to sit  
In the background it stays hid, until they flip the switch  
Then your alter steps in leaving you with no defense  

Super Soldiers are created in military basements  
Secret Space programs and Lunar Operations  
Depend on Trauma Based Mind Control for the basics  
All these Alien Abduction cases need to be investigated  

Karla Turner got murdered for uncovering the truth  
That our Government is working with these Aliens too  
She pieced together book reports comparing interviews  
Of Abductees who remembered seeing military goons  

But Before she got a chance to take a closer look  
She mysteriously died from Cancer - So her 4th book  
Was never written, Every influential Soul becomes a Victim  
In this wicked system if they mention certain issues  

So with this Pencil instrumentals become my Official  
Purposefully defiant way to perform this Dental  
Surgery without Credentials - My Epistles blow the Whistle  
But this music's Detrimental to this System - So just listen  

MK-ULTRA and Project Artichoke aren't a Joke  
Mind Control steals Souls and Satanists invoke  
Dark Entities with Ritual Abuse - I hope  
You take this seriously as you hear these words being spoke  

This world's insane - Can't you see they made it this way  
But you're okay if you don't look or read these books - Just be Afraid  
Denying facts keeps it intact - This Matrix will remain  
Until this Evil shit's confronted - So I'm wondering who's Brave  

I come through gunnin' down everything in my way  
Where's the Devil at? - I'll attack him too, I'm not afraid  
My existence means resistance - I insist on always saying  
Shit that lets these bitches know that I'm not playing  

They'll have to kill me to conceal these verses I've said  
Every curse will be reversed as incantations spread  
I possess enough Magick to unravel every thread  
Of the Veil that keeps them hid and just cut off their heads

Lyrical Dissection & Commentary
Track: Abreactions — Milabs (2022)

This track is a diagnostic. A confession. A weapon.

The title alone — Abreactions — names the process of unconscious trauma bleeding to the surface when triggered. Hawk Eye isn’t just narrating the symptoms. He’s deliberately triggering the release. Every verse is a psychic shockwave meant to activate suppressed memories — in the artist and the listener.

⸻

🧠 Psychic Splintering

“Mind control experiments fracture you until a split / Personality exists”
This section walks us directly through trauma-based mind control methodology, connecting it to MK-ULTRA, Project Artichoke, and SRA (Satanic Ritual Abuse).
The goal of these programs? Shatter the soul and program the pieces.

🧬 Trigger = Activation

Hawk Eye uses rap not just to inform — but to trigger memory fragments. The line:

“Everything comes back — Crystal Clear Abreactions”
suggests that his rhymes bypass amnesic barriers and invoke buried traumas the system hoped would stay hidden.

👽 Milabs Begins Here

This is the first track to openly name:
	•	Super Soldiers
	•	Secret Space Programs
	•	Military-Alien Collaboration
	•	Karla Turner’s assassination

The paranoia isn’t performative — it’s testimony. And Hawk Eye’s not just citing sources. He’s continuing the work that got others silenced.

⸻

🔥 Poetic Defiance

“They’ll have to kill me to conceal these verses I’ve said”
He knows the cost. So did Karla. So did Max. So did Cooper.
And this is the turning point — the declaration that even if death comes, the spells are already loose.

⸻

✍️ Key Quotes:
	•	“Screen memories replace and erase all data” — classic MILAB amnesia implant
	•	“Surgery without credentials” — lyrical activism as psychic healing
	•	“This world’s insane — can’t you see they made it this way?” — direct indictment of the architects

⸻

🎥 Suggested Visuals:
	•	Flickering overlay of Karla Turner, Project Monarch, and MILAB testimony
	•	Fractal split-screen of personality alters activating
	•	Lyric video presented as declassified document scan

⸻

Abreactions is more than catharsis.
It’s psychic retrieval through spiritual rebellion.

The war is now beneath the surface.
