> Yo, when I say legion, what you think I mean I got a horde of fucking demons with me, bout to intervene  
If my team comes to your region, just know that this machine can't be stopped  
So don't concoct any fucking schemes  
And when I mention my gorillas in the trenches Did you listen, or did you think I was playing  

When I said this isn't finished, when I call it an invasion  
Do you hear what I am saying, or do you just think this wordplay is a game  
I'm too patient, this art of war is so deceptive  
I'm telling you the truth, so that you will not accept it  

Cause I want you to assume  
That I'm lying, but expect it, we are coming for you soon  
My legion's not what you thought, but here Let me introduce my team that's standing  
At the ready, anonymously assembled  

I'm handing out machetes, so honestly you should tremble  
If I get the word, you dead, see no ebonics from my dental  
When I say this shit, I meant it  
And it's not because I'm mental, you don't know who we are  

But you see this hulk, spitting rhymes  
And it's bizarre, cause when you hear me talk You know if my words leave a scar, well then you're marked  
This hit list of encrypted text is just a walk in the park  
And I can do this shit all day, I'm not fucking around  

So when my gun starts to spray, everyone should get down  
On their knees and start to pray That what comes out my mouth  
Isn't an order from this warlord, you hear bumping and sound  
You never know who might run up and fucking spray you with a pump  

I bet you think this is a bluff, but that's okay I've had enough of fucking warning all  
You chumps About the storm that you've kicked up  
So when these foreigners pull up with fucking AKs, don't act tough  
Say your prayers, you've met the legion My team is there for a reason  

I don't care if you can't see them, they're prepared to start deleting  
Every terrorist this evening, you're too scared to not believe in  
My warfare is there to reach in, and I'm swearing That I'll keep them running  
Scared as I keep preaching, these fucking leeches are weakened  

With my staring every beat, they are aware of this mystique  
It's fairly fair, cause all this heat leaves them impaired  
So as I speak, my tongue prepares another treat For their nightmares, I go to sleep  
This is a true story, I'm not up here telling lies  

And I got the proof for you, when you see through the disguise  
All my troops' glory will be revealed in their eyes  
And there's no use in warring, guess my legion now realize

Lyrical Dissection & Commentary
Track: Legion — Milabs (2022)

“Legion” is not just a roll call — it’s a battle anthem for the invisible army.
A spiritual alert. A cybernetic invocation. A final warning.
This is Hawk Eye reintroducing himself as the Warlord of the Word, backed by a decentralized force of unseen allies.

⸻

🕶️ The Myth of the One — Shattered

“My legion’s not what you thought… anonymously assembled”

This isn’t ego. It’s echo.
Hawk Eye dissolves the myth of the lone revolutionary and reveals a distributed, rhizomatic resistance.
His “legion” isn’t made of men — it’s made of guerilla frequencies, operatives, agents, watchers, some in flesh, others in code.

⸻

🧠 Psychic Armor, Lyrical Ammunition

“This hit list of encrypted text is just a walk in the park”

Each bar becomes a payload.
The “encrypted text” is both threat and protection — cloaked messages to those with the eyes (and ears) to decode it.
It’s the lyrical form of psychic steganography — designed to slip past censorship and embed truth.

⸻

🔫 Warrior-Poet Energy

“When my gun starts to spray / everyone should get down”

Symbolic or literal, Hawk Eye’s delivery carries the cadence of a trained combatant.
The words mimic a military drill — as if flow = fire.
The war is waged through sonic rituals — verse as gunfire, cadence as command.

⸻

👁️‍🗨️ Return of the Unseen

“You don’t know who we are… But you see this hawk, spitting rhymes”

The wordplay marries surveillance and spirit.
The hawk flies above, unseen until the strike.
This is Hawk Eye’s mythic signature — reincarnated resistance embedded in animal totem, digital tribe, and prophetic mission.

⸻

⚡ Key Motifs
	•	🧱 Cybernetic Jungle — anonymous operators, unseen triggers
	•	🔗 Call to Shadow Alliances — those who hide in plain sight, waiting for the word
	•	📡 Spoken Orders — his lyrics activate, not entertain
	•	⛓️ Encrypted Prophecy — each verse feels like a transcript of a future war

⸻

🧪 Suggested Visuals:
	•	A glowing red sigil labeled LEGIØN projected over a digital map of Earth
	•	Shadowy silhouettes in trench coats holding Machetes + USB drives
	•	Hawk Eye perched atop a tower, flanked by avatars of anonymous allies
	•	Every beat drop flashes leaked military docs, whistleblower portraits, blacked-out ops maps

⸻

🧿 Closing Transmission:

“This is a true story, I’m not up here telling lies…”

Legion is both autobiography and testimony.
It tells the world: he’s not alone, and he’s not bluffing.
You can doubt the name. But you will learn to fear the presence.
