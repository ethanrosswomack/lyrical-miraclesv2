> **Lyrics — Web Format**
> I tried to warn you, but you wouldn't fucking listen  
I tried to warn you, but you wouldn't fucking listen  
Yo, if they ever wake up, you never know  
These sheep are sick, so fuck them every once  

A sitting duck by me, my thunder rumbles, loading my gun  
I come equipped with shit to make you wonder if you should run  
Or get under collective covers, head in the sand  
Ain't gonna help you, don't you know the government has a plan  

For FEMA camps, do what you're told  
Every man worth a damn needs to stand  
And never fold, but you cowards just demand more gun bans  
So I throw my weapons off until the cop gets killed, it's awful  

And I ought to yield, but never will I pop the seal  
Unless I put some stock for real, so stop and think it through  
Or get dropped, and the news can concoct another crock of shit  
I'm not gonna lose, stand alone against the world  

With these beats I hurl, dragging speech until you freak  
So treat it, eat each word, supplying heat to keep you weak  
My rhyme scheme's unique, so every time you hear these lines  
Don't try to find my peak, I'm flying higher than entire empires  

When I flow, you'll never know how inspired I might get  
So, just pay attention when I mention this shit's itching to bewitch them  
As you listen, my intention twists the wrist, now bitch, moan  
If you puppets won't wake up, I guess I'll stuff you in the trunk  

My fucking trumpet will erupt till you corrupted bitches back  
I'll never let you fuckers live in peace pretending  
You're still asleep, I'm sending shit to kill the beat  
Until you bend your will to me  

Yeah, and what the fuck you mean that you don't know about this  
It's emergency  
Federal enforcement agents shooting round after round  
At American patriots now  

Yeah, and I'm not fucking around  
You wouldn't wake up, so I made this tape and fuck it, I'm out  
I tried to warn you, but you wouldn't fucking listen  
I tried to warn you, but you wouldn't fucking listen  

Why won't you people wake up? I'm still here speaking this stuff  
But no one's listening, I've written enough  
I'm tired of trying, don't know why I'm spending time on you fucks  
You're too corrupted by the system, you're a victim who trusts  

Governmental superstitions, you're convinced that you must  
Let politicians make decisions, you're a prisoner, but  
I came to fuck the system with just holy wisdom and luck  
So hear these words, don't sit and bitch, then get up  

You're not asleep, you're just scared, so believe me, I dare you  
To keep looking away till it's too late, be aware  
New orders for the world get recorded and unfurled  
Through televised bullshit, they worded for your view  

Unsuspecting has to accept no regrets  
Just a checklist of nonsense we all get to let  
Turn us into animals, doing our best  
To comply with what the TV says, you getting it yet  

FEMA camps, if you can't follow rules, then you can  
Be exterminated legally by demons who stand  
In uniform, super form, act a war against your human rights  
There's nothing nice about it, are you sure  

The virus is a phase one of Agenda 21  
I mean, it's 2021 after all, so should we run  
Everybody's wearing masks, if they try to take our guns  
They'll probably only have to ask us Americans once  

Yeah, and what the fuck you mean that you don't know about this  
It's emergency, federal enforcement agents shooting round after round  
At American patriots now, yeah  
Yeah, and I'm not fucking around  

You wouldn't wake up, so I made this tape and fuck it, I'm out  
I tried to warn you, but you wouldn't fucking listen  
I tried to warn you, but you wouldn't fucking listen  
This war is more important than anyone before it  

Know your place or I'll erase you and your face won't get reported  
If no one here would know your name or even show it  
Any interest in the witnesses who mentioned it, so  
Forget what you had planned, I do not give a damn  

Even if Uncle Sam re-enlists, every man is not enough for you to stop me  
Call the coroner and watch, I'll pour another pot of coffee till the story gets hot  
Every journalist reporting this shit is getting shot  
Guerrilla warfare doesn't care if it's fair or not  

When martial law's declared, don't be scared, be a threat  
Militia troops shooting through, bulletproof vests  
I don't know if you've heard, but shit's getting real, it's true  
Lead to pick sides, now bitch, they've sealed  

Off the fucking country, you can't leave if you try  
COVID killed Epstein's story, so now I  
Gotta resurrect my tribe of warrior gods  
Wrapped in flesh and refresh Satan's memory, ah  

He'd forget about the best from the west we came  
Thunderbirds who would turn with a fiery flame  
Yeah, and what the fuck you mean  
If you don't know about this, it's emergency  

Federal enforcement agents shooting round after round  
At American patriots now  
Yeah, and I'm not fucking around  
You wouldn't wake up, so I made this tape and fuck it, I'm out  

I tried to warn you, but you wouldn't fucking listen  
I tried to warn you, but you wouldn't fucking listen  
I tried to warn you, but you wouldn't fucking listen

Lyrical Dissection & Commentary
Track: FEMA — Milabs (2022)

“FEMA” is Hawk Eye’s broadcast from the edge of martial law.
It’s not a song — it’s a siren. A warning wrapped in war drums.
From FEMA camps and forced compliance to psychological surrender and systemic apathy, this track tears into the post-COVID surveillance state with prophetic fury.

⸻

🧨 Opening Salvo: The Refrain That Haunts

“I tried to warn you, but you wouldn’t fucking listen…”

This phrase echoes like a ghost across the track.
It’s part lament, part indictment.
It frames the song as a last will and testament — Hawk Eye has been sounding the alarm, and now he’s at war with the silence.

⸻

🏕️ FEMA Camps & Agenda 21: Militant Exposé

“FEMA camps, do what you’re told / Every man worth a damn needs to stand…”

The track’s title is a direct callout. These aren’t metaphorical prisons — they’re literal death machinery wrapped in bureaucracy.
Hawk Eye accuses the system of preparing legalized genocide under the guise of emergency management.

“The virus is a phase one of Agenda 21…”
He links pandemic policy to deeper technocratic goals — population control, data surveillance, and mass sedation.

⸻

📺 Mass Hypnosis & Digital Propaganda

“New orders for the world get recorded and unfurled / Through televised bullshit…”

Hawk Eye asserts that television is the new pulpit of propaganda.
We don’t resist because we’ve been programmed not to.
He doesn’t just attack the screen — he attacks the mechanism of trust itself.

⸻

🧠 Apathy as Complicity

“You’re not asleep, you’re just scared…”

This line is brutal. It strips away the comfort of ignorance and calls it what it is — cowardice.
The track isn’t forgiving. It doesn’t coddle. It demands awareness through action.

⸻

🔥 Return of the Thunderbirds

“Gotta resurrect my tribe of warrior gods…”

As the track closes, Hawk Eye invokes mythic reinforcements. Thunderbirds, star warriors, ancient flame-walkers — this isn’t just rebellion, it’s cosmic retribution.
He reminds the enemy (and the listener) that divine vengeance is not only possible — it’s inevitable.

⸻

🧪 Suggested Visuals:
	•	A television melting into barbed wire
	•	FEMA camp blueprints overlaying drone surveillance footage
	•	Thunderbirds rising from burning cities
	•	Hawk Eye surrounded by shadowy watchers as his bars ignite the screen

⸻

🔓 Key Motifs:
	•	State terrorism disguised as safety
	•	Psychic sleepwalking of the masses
	•	Rhymes as riot calls
	•	Divine militia encoded in lyrics

⸻

“FEMA” is where Hawk Eye stops preaching and starts kicking doors down.
It’s martial, metaphysical, and made to shock the sleep out of your skull.
This is a warning shot for the apocalypse — and the battlefield is your mind.
