# EverLight's Rite: Malicious EP

**Overview:**  
A short and deadly barrage. These 4 tracks are expletive-laced spells of vengeance, truth, and revolt. They don't pretend to be palatable. They’re warnings, all caps, and utterly undeniable.

**Symbolism & Themes:**  
- 🧨 Retaliation Rituals  
- 🪬 Shield-breaking hexes  
- 🕷️ Total linguistic combat

**Commentary:**  
This EP is the sound of weaponized defiance. If “Reincarnated to Resist” was the anthem, “Malicious” was the kill switch.
