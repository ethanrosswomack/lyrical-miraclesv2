# EverLight's Rite: MILABS (2022)

**Overview:**  
MILABS (Military Abductions) is a dark spiral through trauma memory, classified programs, and soul reclamation. Here, Hawk Eye becomes the archivist of humanity’s shadow: from implants to mind control to FEMA camps.

**Symbolism & Themes:**  
- 👁️ Recovered Memories  
- 🧬 Split Personality Conditioning  
- 🛸 Secret Space Program Survivorship

**Commentary:**  
The entire project is its own deprogramming protocol. These are not just songs; they are recoveries, remembrance rites, and field manuals for souls who've been splintered and stitched by black ops.
