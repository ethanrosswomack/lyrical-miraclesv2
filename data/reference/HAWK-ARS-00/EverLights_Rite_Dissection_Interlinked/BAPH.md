## BAPH: Dissection

*Behold A Pale Horse* is not merely a debut—it is a declaration.

Each track evokes an escalating awareness of systemic corruption, spiritual warfare, and inner activation.

Key Themes:
- Milton William Cooper (dedication and thematic thread)
- Warning Shots (Track 1) as prophecy
- Track 11 as the conclusion and reincarnative announcement of future waves

🔥 All fire, no filler. Classic format of Hawk Eye.
