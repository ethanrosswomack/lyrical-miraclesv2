## Phase II: Sun Tzu & The Next Wave

Something’s coming. ‘Phase II’ is no gimmick.

The lyrical finality of *Reincarnated 2 Resist* shows closure of the original ‘Mixtape Sessions’ arc.

But hints are everywhere:
- Sun Tzu title references
- Martial metaphors increasing
- Aesthetic shifts in Return of Kings / The Vow

**Hypothesis:**
Sun Tzu will represent the War Manual.
The gospel according to resistance.
The scripts to reverse the curse.

👁️🕊️ And with his light—we rise.
