Coincidentally, I'm simply the archenemy of any
Motherfucker too corrupted by the system - Now just listen
My intentional offensive wordplay is condescending
It's unrelenting when I'm sending incendiary transmissions

Don't you bitches get it yet, or do you need another threat
I will position my technicians right in your kitchen - Let me check
Which politician should I mention? If you didn't hear me yet
It's my mission to resist - Here's my official evidence

I'm murdering microphones as I compose a spiteful poem - My opponents
Know I'm not the one to be fucked with - I have the right components
I am what you're stuck with now - And this cypher's hyper-focused
Sniper's loaded - Viper Bolt end life before your eyes, it won't

Miss - I must insist, you bitches, really see the picture
This Epistle on my lips is like a missile - It's off the Richter
And the Scripture I submit intervenes - That's why I spit this
Holy Fire - Burning liars - My empire's too legit

For your schemes and propaganda to command a damn thing
And my whole team's a rebel band of Jedi Samurai who bring
Retribution to you mutant, anti-human foreign nuisance
Artificial motherfuckers - My adjustment bureau doesn't

Fuck around - They do their job, expert work like ancient gods
Resurrected to correct a damn infection - It's so odd
That you'd forget about this shit - Cause Westside is what you'll get
Every time - Let me remind you, this is a war that you can't win

And I'm certainly far beyond your comprehension
Bars I spawned and then suspended
Right above your head mention, my position
Is within reach

But if you bitches try to lift this weight I placed

I hope you take some time to reassess the situation you face

Cause I'll break each fucking one of you - Greatness is what's coming through

I'll wake my legion just to do what I already said - My Crew

Is like a sleeping giant - Too defiant to be stopped - So when we riot, non-compliance

Isn't an option - You rotten fucks need a coffin? Carpenter Jesus has got them

Best believe me, we're watching - yeah

And I'm dismantling everything - You can't cancel or bury me

I'm the very first person you can't hurt - It get's worse

My murderous lyrics are more than words - You can feel it

In your spirit - That's why I am here to make sure you fear it

Your reign of terror has ended - Bear witness to this druidic

Apocalypse I came equipped to fucking share with you idiots

Do you need another line, or is this enough rhymed

Conversation? I am patiently waiting for your reply

My whole statement here is basically just me creating ways to keep

Bending words around the beat - Offending slurs wounds wound so neatly

But don't you see how effortlessly I'm communicating

Every fucking sentence in this track is just me demonstrating

It's uncommon for anyone to speak so clear

And say what they mean without dissembling and never veer

Off course - Away from subject - Sidebar the discussion

When I speak you know I meant for you to hear me - So fuck it

I'm done pretending to give a shit - You can all go to hell

Reptilian puppets and Illuminati fuckwits - Oh well
