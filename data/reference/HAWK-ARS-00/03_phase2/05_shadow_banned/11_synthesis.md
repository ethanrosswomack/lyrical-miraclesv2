This is Alchemy you see
And if I had to boil it all down
And give you an explanation of what my music is here to do
Basically

We're synthesizing as we speak
This alchemist is here to tweak
Your frequency - adjust the heat
As we discuss what's underneath
Below the surface lies your purpose
These rhymes are here to focus
And show you it's not hopeless
Don't you know my rhyme is potent
I have spoken to Invoke and channel in
Through words I've wrote
Words all men begin to quote
When what I send to them promotes
Shit you simpletons just won't
You play pretend - But then I don't
Suddenly I end the vote
And No One bends the knee - Nope
This system gets rewritten
Overridden, Stripped, Decrypted
It's my mission to resist
All parts of it which didn't fit
Delete the script and then evict
These Demons seeking to commit
Atrocious crimes and keep this shit
From coming back - So my lyrics
Hit the central artificial
Nervous bitches that I mentioned
With a forceful intervention too persistent
My ballistic missile rip through your defenses
You won't get to take offensive measures - Why
Because you'll die before I ever let you try

Cause I suggest you quit while your ahead

You're at war with the Lord

So you'll need more

Ammunition - Do you bitches

Really think that you're

Equipped for this shit

And are you sure

Before You whores

Get incinerated - This is

Basically what I am saying

You have witnessed my relentless

Wicked Sentences conveying

I'm omnipotent

Heaven sent

And I just want to say

What the fuck did you expect?

I'm omnipotent

Heaven sent

And I just want to say

You have witnessed my relentless

Wicked Sentences conveying

I'm omnipotent

Heaven sent

And I just want to say

The Tribe I'm vibing with

Inspired Souls on Fire show it

Is required by a Higher Power to unfold this

Holy Wisdom - Cripple Systems

Decommission Agent Smiths

Wake humanity The Sleeping Giant

Can't you see Bitch

No one cares about your plans

Fuck your Mason Team - Quit

Believing that the schemes

Of Demons won't be ripped

By the root from this Planetary Grid

We were Sent

To prevent you kids

From ever getting a Grip

So let me spell it out

For every one of you too ignorant

To understand these rhythmic sentences

I slipped into the script

You will exit stage left

And your wicked shit will get

Burned to ash - You cannot match

What you have just come up against

What the fuck did you expect? Hawk is back to Resurrect

What the fuck did you expect? Hawk is back to Resurrect

What the fuck did you expect? Hawk is back to Resurrect

It's night that runs away when the Sun comes to play

And Rain falls where it wants - No it won't be restrained

Natural Law says Trees are required or don't Breathe

And Humanity's the Guardian of this Garden - So leave

I have never lost a War - Every Star system knows

Hawk Eye, Warlord of Light never fights, all foes

Surrender to the Ender of Battling Pretenders

I'm a force not even Satan tries Taking on

What the fuck did you expect? Hawk is back to Resurrect

Get incinerated - This is basically what I am saying

Cause I suggest you quit while your ahead

And you're at war with the Lord

So you'll need more

Ammunition - Do you bitches

Really think that you're

Equipped for this shit

And are you sure

Hawk is back to Resurrect

I'm omnipotent - Heaven sent

My wicked sentences convey

What the fuck did you expect? Hawk is back to resurrect

You have witnessed my relentless wicked sentences

Don't get incinerated
