Yeah - The shadow is rising
Does anybody know a rapper?
Someone who writes raps?

My influential instrumental artistry is beneficial
It's official - I am with you like a subatomic missile
I Aim this pencil - This shit hits who ever gets in it's way
If you artificial motherfuckers
Want a War here's what you'll suffer
Every undercover brother
Will discover there's no buffer
When my tongue delivers another word
No puns intended but something you're
Forgetting is I am beginning
This unrelenting and absurd
Lyrical poetic flow so you'll know
When I speak slow - You should listen
Quit your bitching before I call the Mortician
Coroner and fucking cops to come get you
When I pop off a few shots and watch you drop
My aim is true and you do Not
Get the picture I intend
To paint for you within this scripture
But penmanship like this
Can quickly shift and rearrange the mixture
Speed the pace up just a bit
What amazing wicked shit
Can I say to make you take a break
From hating what's Legit
Oh I know
I'll sing this song for you
I think it goes like this

Authentic original - Symbolic rituals
Words that I spit are like cryptic and mystical
Sigils I've written all over - Invading your Soul

I told you, this witchcraft is biblical

Spiritual Indigo here to kill Wendigo

My Holy Fire entirely filtered through

Lyrical Rhythmic Descriptive Specific

Empirical Sentences - Bitch you are Listening

To the Wordsmith Bird - Or haven't you heard

I've returned with my whole tribe

Burning down old Lies

And no I don't give a fuck if you hoes try

To stop me - I'll kill your whole posse

I'm not what you pussy's thought

Bring you an Army, the Navy and maybe

A veteran line up of better men

Than what you bitches provided - It's evident

Heaven sent me to make war

Against all you terrorists

I am what you're

Unprepared to deal with

Murderous lyrics leave my lips and sure

I can rap faster or slow this shit down

It's not like it matters - I told you clowns

This isn't a circus - I'm here to kill serpents

Throw 'em in the furnace - You're learning this now

I am the Lion of Judah

More Christ-like than Buddha

My holy empire is rising - Anubis

To all of you fools who've been trying to rule

This is my world, you little girls

Better play nice or with this Sword

Of Truth in mouth, I'll convince the Lord

Of Hosts to invoke omnipotent Hocus Pocus

You think it's a joke

I am the ender of wars across stars

Galactic Commander of Heavenly Hordes

Sun Tzu - Do you ever regret

Never letting your enemies up off the floor

Me neither - Kill 'em again and then leave a

Monument for men to believe in

Something impossible happened

The whole damn battalion

Got murdered by him this evening

Reminding you fuck niggas not to play games

With your life - The world is a stage

But I'm writing the script

Don't make me invent

New ways to say

I don't give a shit

If you ever again take a breath or get rest

Fuck your entire pathetic existence

I'm letting you know right now, as clear as I can

You don't want me to show my hand

Because the Devil and several others

All running for cover when they see me coming

Should tell you something

I'll rip down the Kingdom

Annoy the shit outta God while I'm at it

And if he attacks His end will be tragic

Apocalyse Now - Roll back the clouds

Unveiling the mystery of what sounds

Like Higher Divine - Sacred Aligned

Cosmic Unfoldment of Holy Design

I am the Craftsman, the Poet, the Rhyme

Said I'd be back and now I am - So Hi

Reincarnated to resist

You motherfuckers won't believe this

But long ago I told you no

One ever can extinguish

Our Vibe - So why have I returned

Soul Tribe knows My entire Verse

Of Violent Rhymes reverse the Curse

Spells Bind these Tyrants - I invert

The whole game that they play

And I make 'em say

If it weren't for me

Then they'd be okay

But I am here now, and you best fuckin' fear it

These lyrics are Spiritually Resonant

And I know that you Hear it

I am what you all want to kill

But Karma is real - So just know I will

Keep popping up and leaving it all fucked

I'm deleting the mainframe that are plugged directly into

You're hesitant to look in the mirror and see who

You really are - But I see your Soul

I got a Hawk's Eye view bitch didn't you know

Nothing can hide - Everything's clear

Darkness retreats when light reveals

What lies beneath the surface

Reminding me to work with energies I find

Deep inside Blinded Men

That's why I speak my rhyme

Awaken the dead -Lazarus yeah

Get your ass up

You heard what I said

More evil than them came to seek and destroy every demon
