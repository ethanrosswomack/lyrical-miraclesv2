Yeah - This is my Invokation
Listen, By Earth - Wind - Fire and Sea
I Prevail Without Fail - I'm not fighting, I'm free
By Earth - Wind - Fire and Sea
I Prevail Without Fail - I'm not fighting, I'm free

Yo - Summon every single Demon you can bring
I wanna see which of you bitches stand against this Machine
All my inspired fire burns away defenses
I've returned to make you witness
My Emergence - This is urgent
Call the Nurses and the Surgeons
My rebirth upon this Earth isn't the first
And I'll be back every time this curse inverts
And skirts the line - I wrote this track
To reverse the damage Serpent hands
Inflicted to pervert the Land
Their wicked work alerts me
To come quick and spit a Verse see
I am Heaven Sent - It's evident - I'm never gonna quit
You bitches better get your weapons out and empty every clip
I'm far beyond your comprehension
So  miss me with your bullshit
My intention is to make sure that you listen
My Grand design was planned before I Ever came to be
Inside this Man you see in front of you
I am the fucking One to do
What's needed to be done - So who
Can stop me - Come and Watch
The opposition die defending their position

Look, don't try to murder me
Bitch have you heard of The
Bird who with words will end your life
It's so absurd you see
Outlaw Immortals came through portals

To make sure shit's in Order

Tried to murder me

Bitch have you heard of The

Bird who with words will end your life

It's so absurd you see

Outlaw Immortals come through portals

Just to make sure shit's in Order

By my Life Eternal Fire burning right through your Entire

By my Life Eternal Fire burning right through your Entire

Military forces - So be sure it's a Death Sentence you want

Before I schedule your deletion Try retreating - I am not

Fucking around - Across the ground, scattered ash is all that's found

After my lips emit this shit that fucking burns you to a crisp

And I admit, my Incantations

Made you witness my Invasive

Witchcraft stir up shit and break foundations

But now I'm bound to be the Sound

That you'll wish that you had never Found

Inside your ear there's no way out

These words are sealed - Without a doubt

I'll keep you listening to interesting Mysterious Lyrics

I'm serious as fuck  - This will be stuck like Period Sentences

I invoke emotional spiritual openness hoping that what I wrote

Holds your whole focus till you don't even know

It's Spirit flowing through a Poet

That's so potent opponents

Know there's no hope in overthrowing

Those exposed to what's Spoken

Souls I've awoken get to show

That my whole wordplay is an Ocean

Flooding Earth today so No One

Gets to say that No One told them

Don't try to murder me

Bitch have you heard of The

Bird who with words will end your life

It's so absurd you see

Outlaw Immortals came through portals

To make sure shit's in Order

Try to murder me

Bitch have you heard of The

Bird who with words will end your life

It's so absurd you see

Outlaw Immortals come through portals

To make sure shit's in Order

By my Life Eternal Fire burning right through your Entire

By my Life Eternal Fire burning right through your Entire

Serpent Choir - Then retire the whole line-up of Liars

Erase every fucking trace of the shit show inspired

By divisive hypnotizing polarized scriptwriting

Broadcasted through devices planted everywhere blinding

Every unaware Soul

Kept under control

By Elite Billionaire

Snake worshipping clones

I speak to keep you freaks aware of this Leash that I hold

Don't even think that I won't Delete everything that you own

I'll break the Matrix - Rearrange it - Then replace every Agent

With sleeper cell infiltrators who can't wait for my Statements

I'll make you hate for me to Mention any names of politicians

When I'm on stage - Cause when my Guerilla's Listen

Suddenly an intervention of violent and sadistic

Intentional persistent random rioting citizens

Take charge and decommission

Every demon I've gifted with my attention

All you bitches need to learn what this shit is

Was a joke or something focused on provoking these Locusts

To come and tear away the veil and leave you broken and hopeless

My apprentices kill witnesses

And throw 'em in ditches

No stitches for the snitches

I let no man convicted

Of assisting my victims

Even know I've enlisted

Them to serve the front lines

Yeah, down in the Trenches

If they're murdered - Oh well

I hope they're burning in hell

When I invoke this hocus pocus

No one knows if my Spell

Look, don't try to murder me

Bitch have you heard of The

Bird who with words will end your life

It's so absurd you see

Outlaw Immortals came through portals

To make sure shit's in Order

Try to murder me

Bitch have you heard of The

Bird who with words will end your life

It's so absurd you see

Outlaw Immortals come through portals

Just to make sure shit's in Order

Earth - Wind - Fire and Sea

I prevail without fail

I'm not fighting - I'm free

By my Life Eternal Fire burning right through your Entire

By my Life Eternal Fire burning right through your Entire
