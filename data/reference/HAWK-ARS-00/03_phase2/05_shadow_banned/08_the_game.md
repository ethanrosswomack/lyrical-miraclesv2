Yo, since you bitches wanna play
Let me just fucking say
You're not equipped for all this shit that I am pushing in your brain
And I warned you that one day
You'd push me to the edge
And then I'd motherfucking snap
So Listen close cause what I said
Was Since you bitches wanna play
Well just let me fucking say

Look - you're playing checkers with your life
And this lecture that I write
Is a gesture I expect you to respect or I might
Teach you a lesson - Any questions I confess this rhyme session
Is a weaponized method my specialized epic
Lyrical threats wreck into every section with
I'm here to bury my sentences into wary apprentices
Kill each witness with wicked poetic spells so specific
That no one can tell when listening, but there's various instances
Of hypnotic deposits slipped to you through this tonic
It's ironic moronic neurotic fools spewing vomit
Are the ones my harmonic truthful supersonic
Cosmic phonic mnemonic composite offering wanted
To infect and subject to whatever comes next
A mind opened by spoken hocus pocus won't get
To close it or let what's awoken die yet
So I hope you guys focus on the Soul Inside - Let's
Get back to business - If you bitches really wanna die, listen
I can hit you with this divine wisdom
The biblical epistles I've penciled paint the picture
My Holy Scripture is so legit - What I've written
No official even tries to contradict, I spit that shit no one prevents
They fuckin' know I am the poet no opponent can resist
I'm so cold even though I'm spitting fire
What I composed instantly froze the empire - So bitch

You're not equipped for all this shit that I am pushing in your brain

Yo, since you bitches wanna play

Let me just fucking say

And I warned you that one day

You'd push me to the edge

And then I'd motherfucking snap

So Listen close cause what I said

Was Since you bitches wanna play

Well just let me fucking say

Yo, since you bitches wanna play

And I warned you that one day

You'd push me to the edge

And then I'd motherfucking snap

So Listen close cause what I said

Was Since you bitches wanna play

Well just let me fucking say

You're not equipped for all this shit that I am pushing in your brain

If I threatened God himself, all Angels would just quit

Protecting Heaven's Throne - Yeah, they'd Abandon Ship

They'd leave their position at the slightest fucking mention

Of any intention I had to turn weapons their direction

It's effective - I am something like Legendary Adversary

God created Satan just to Catch Me

But that fucker learned not to ever damn cross

The One holding the gun - I'm hot like the Sun

I melt away the competition - Every day I'm on a mission

Even God himself couldn't repel or ever stop, so listen

Isn't it odd how Hawk Eye came through just in time

For the 2020 bullshitting New World Order bullpen

To put in their best pitcher, but I'm a switch hitter

I'm so gifted with this stick it's like I'm meant to always get

A perfectly rehearsed inverted lyrical new verse

My rhythmic sentence structure doesn't rupture when I puncture every lung - You're

Gonna hear my words and wonder - What the fuck? How'd the eruption

Of this Bird that we're under sound just like thunder

but somehow outside this Realm in another

World, words he hurled ripped through the curtain and pearls

Of wisdom came to kiss the lips of innocent ministers

To convince them the denizens of this twisted and menacing

Wicked System would listen if those opposed start resisting

The venomous hypocritical silence tyrants insisted

You're not equipped for all this shit that I am pushing in your brain

Since you bitches wanna play

Let me just fucking say

And I warned you that one day

You'd push me to the edge

And then I'd motherfucking snap

So listen close cause what I said

Was since you bitches wanna play

You'll wind up dead
