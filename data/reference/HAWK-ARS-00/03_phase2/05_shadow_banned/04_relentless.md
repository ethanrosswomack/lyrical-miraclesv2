Uh-huh, it's Hawk Eye, back again, just like I told you I'd be
I reincarnated to resist, and I do not give a shit
I reincarnated to resist, and I do not give a shit

Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day
You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game
Come up with something more constructive to discuss
I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become
I'm about to fucking invade
Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day
You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game
Come up with something more constructive to discuss
I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become
I'm about to fucking invade

With a persistent and relentless run on sentence
My lyrical intervention shifts the spiritual imprint of the system
The atmospheric conditions are fully cleared when this wisdom
Leaves my lips and you listen to the words you are hearing
Cause I'm a poet so potent, my one and only opponent
Composed a flow so cold, you know the words I spoke went and froze it
If they rewrote it to show me they could go toe to toe
I'd overload the voltage so it'd blow a hole through their soul
My destination is too great for anyone to debate
And I'm on my way to replace complacent tasteless mistakes
Create a basic data bank of who can stay and who can't
After I change the fucking game and rearrange everything
Cause when I step up to the mic and tell you cunts to play nice
I ain't joking, I have opened many minds with my light
My spoken hocus pocus focuses these words that I write
So that it provokes you hopeless vocalists too broken to fight
To come and find out how serious my rhymes get - You're delirious
I can amputate the complicated simply inferior, twisted methods you've molested
And correct the interior subtle purpose I have worked to insert between periods

Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day

You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game

Come up with something more constructive to discuss

I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become

I'm about to fucking invade

Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day

You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game

Come up with something more constructive to discuss

I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become

I'm about to fucking invade

My sentence structure can rupture corrupted men

When this otherworldly pen I'm writing with begins erupting

Oh brothers, come and see if any who suffer my wrath

Pretend these are nothing but raps

After my attack, I bet you fuckers never come back

Combative obstinate obstacles - I imagined impossible

Dragons talking about how I have somehow managed to conquer you

With unstoppable force, I send immovable course

Corrections your direction, just a let you know second guessing

My methodology, which even God can't believe

Is reckless as thinking my weapons aren't effective - You need

Another lesson - Let me threaten to shoot through your protective vest

I bet these rounds still leave holes in your chest

A musical mercenary Heaven sent here to bury

Every unnecessary politician within this very

Broken system through persistent and consistent revisions

Of every sentence ever written by the government with its

Arbitrary library, filled with colorful laws

Retarded bullshit used to circumvent and fucking withdraw

All common sense from the equation - This is something that y'all

Can't even see - How about I say it right in front on the lawn

Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day

You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game

Come up with something more constructive to discuss

I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become

I'm about to fucking invade

Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day

You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game

Come up with something more constructive to discuss

I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become

I'm about to fucking invade

Fuck the White House politicking piece of shit men and women

Who keep pretending this bitch ass system we live in

Is all we've got - What's permitted is full submission

Religious states sanctioned worship of tax dollars we give 'em

Virtual signal competitions - Lying ambitious Christians

Convince the citizens enslaved by this persistent and vicious

Hypnotic scriptwriter's venomous penmanship, to quit bitching

And let Representative Senate Members forget to mention

Anything but how wicked men are still opposed to their mission

Men like me who don't give a fuck, chose intervention

Militia troops in position uproot and then imprison

The guards first - Afterwards it's the Warden who'll listen

To the indictment I bring - It's such a frightening thing

Who would have thought, that all along, no one entered the ring

And called bullshit on the whole act - Evidently I'm back

To spit facts and impact every faction - These rats

Must have forgotten, I'm rotten - Bin Laden optical promptings

Keep 9/11 Building Seven witnesses from unboxing

Massive unstoppable conscious legions of Network Department teams

We've infiltrated to bring the truth to your TV screens

Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day

You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game

Come up with something more constructive to discuss

I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become

I'm about to fucking invade

Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day

You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game

Come up with something more constructive to discuss

I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become

I'm 'bout - I'm 'bout - I'm 'bout to fucking invade

I'm about to fucking invade

I'm about to fucking invade

I'm 'bout - I'm 'bout - I'm 'bout to fucking invade

Uh-huh, it's Hawk Eye, back again, just like I told you I'd be

I reincarnated to resist, and I do not give a shit

I reincarnated to resist, and I do not give a shit

Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day

You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game

Come up with something more constructive to discuss

I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become

I'm about to fucking invade

Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day

You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game

Come up with something more constructive to discuss

I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become

I'm about to fucking invade

With a persistent and relentless run on sentence

My lyrical intervention shifts the spiritual imprint of the system

The atmospheric conditions are fully cleared when this wisdom

Leaves my lips and you listen to the words you are hearing

Cause I'm a poet so potent, my one and only opponent

Composed a flow so cold, you know the words I spoke went and froze it

If they rewrote it to show me they could go toe to toe

I'd overload the voltage so it'd blow a hole through their soul

My destination is too great for anyone to debate

And I'm on my way to replace complacent tasteless mistakes

Create a basic data bank of who can stay and who can't

After I change the fucking game and rearrange everything

Cause when I step up to the mic and tell you cunts to play nice

I ain't joking, I have opened many minds with my light

My spoken hocus pocus focuses these words that I write

So that it provokes you hopeless vocalists too broken to fight

To come and find out how serious my rhymes get - You're delirious

I can amputate the complicated simply inferior, twisted methods you've molested

And correct the interior subtle purpose I have worked to insert between periods

Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day

You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game

Come up with something more constructive to discuss

I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become

I'm about to fucking invade

Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day

You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game

Come up with something more constructive to discuss

I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become

I'm about to fucking invade

My sentence structure can rupture corrupted men

When this otherworldly pen I'm writing with begins erupting

Oh brothers, come and see if any who suffer my wrath

Pretend these are nothing but raps

After my attack, I bet you fuckers never come back

Combative obstinate obstacles - I imagined impossible

Dragons talking about how I have somehow managed to conquer you

With unstoppable force, I send immovable course

Corrections your direction, just a let you know second guessing

My methodology, which even God can't believe

Is reckless as thinking my weapons aren't effective - You need

Another lesson - Let me threaten to shoot through your protective vest

I bet these rounds still leave holes in your chest

A musical mercenary Heaven sent here to bury

Every unnecessary politician within this very

Broken system through persistent and consistent revisions

Of every sentence ever written by the government with its

Arbitrary library, filled with colorful laws

Retarded bullshit used to circumvent and fucking withdraw

All common sense from the equation - This is something that y'all

Can't even see - How about I say it right in front on the lawn

Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day

You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game

Come up with something more constructive to discuss

I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become

I'm about to fucking invade

Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day

You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game

Come up with something more constructive to discuss

I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become

I'm about to fucking invade

Fuck the White House politicking piece of shit men and women

Who keep pretending this bitch ass system we live in

Is all we've got - What's permitted is full submission

Religious states sanctioned worship of tax dollars we give 'em

Virtual signal competitions - Lying ambitious Christians

Convince the citizens enslaved by this persistent and vicious

Hypnotic scriptwriter's venomous penmanship, to quit bitching

And let Representative Senate Members forget to mention

Anything but how wicked men are still opposed to their mission

Men like me who don't give a fuck, chose intervention

Militia troops in position uproot and then imprison

The guards first - Afterwards it's the Warden who'll listen

To the indictment I bring - It's such a frightening thing

Who would have thought, that all along, no one entered the ring

And called bullshit on the whole act - Evidently I'm back

To spit facts and impact every faction - These rats

Must have forgotten, I'm rotten - Bin Laden optical promptings

Keep 9/11 Building Seven witnesses from unboxing

Massive unstoppable conscious legions of Network Department teams

We've infiltrated to bring the truth to your TV screens

Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day

You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game
