## 🔊 Lyrics — Web Format

Yeah  
You are listening to Hawk Eye  
This is the EP - Malicious  
Sent directly from me to you  

Why don't you dumb cunts  
Shut the fuck up  
MotherFucker - What the fuck  
I'm bout to crush you underneath so much  
Weighted words - Hey this bird  
Don't say shit unless it burns  
Away defensive mechanisms  
So you bitches better listen  

Just shut the fuck up  
You're all a bunch of dumb cunts  
And I am bout to crush you underneath so much  

What are you bitches talkin bout  
Don't make me come and shut your mouth  
I know you're busy chasin clout  
Being fake and comin out  
Of the closet - but my offense  
Obviously is so appalling  
You should run away before I say  
The shit you faggots hate  
To hear - but listen dear  
You cocksucking, fuckin queers  
Can try to cancel me all you want  
But you'll never interfere  
I hope you have a fucking heart attack  
Don't start with me - my art is that  
Shit you wish you didn't have to listen to  
But bitch you knew  
Not to come and fuck with me  
I'm what no one confronts - You need  
Another lesson? - Heed the message  
Cause my confession's signed and sealed  

Why don't you dumb cunts  
Shut the fuck up  
MotherFucker - What the fuck  
I'm bout to crush you underneath so much  
Weighted words - Hey this bird  
Don't say shit unless it burns  
Away defensive mechanisms  
So you bitches better listen  

I'm what  
No one confronts  
You need a lesson  
Heed the message  
Cause my confession  
Is signed and sealed  

And I'll mail that bitch in just before  
I call the Sheriff - declare war  
On the entire precinct - Firebombing  
Them and all who see me  
Cause fuck the judge - What no one does  
You know I will - Don't hold a grudge  
I'm just the weapon God has sent in  
To correct the shit you didn't  
All you bitches remain calm  
Hit the deck - it's not what we thought  
Hawk is back - Oh shit  
Is that what He meant  
Yes - I'm dropping bombs  
And what the West did in the desert  
Can't compare - No sand can weather  
The storming thunder my tongue can  
Summon - I am what you never  
Knew existed - true resistance  
Each and all of you've enlisted  
To die soon - But if you didn't  
Get the memo - Here's a hint  

Why don't you dumb cunts  
Shut the fuck up  
MotherFucker - What the fuck  
I'm bout to crush you underneath so much  
Weighted words - Hey this bird  
Don't say shit unless it burns  
Away defensive mechanisms  
So you bitches better listen  

Why don't you dumb cunts  
Shut the fuck up  
MotherFucker - What the fuck  
I'm bout to crush you underneath so much  
Weighted words - Hey this bird  
Don't say shit unless it burns  
Away defensive mechanisms  
So you bitches better listen  

I'm what the Prince of Darkness calls  
An awful image no one saw  
Come and clip his fuckin' balls  
Holy shit - This is what God  
Sent to get the message through  
What the fuck you gonna do  
I'm just a poet too heroic  
For each and all of you

**Lyrical Dissection & Commentary**  
> Track: *Malicious* — The Malicious EP (2024)  

*“Malicious” kicks open the gates of Phase II with a volcanic, unfiltered barrage — not just of anger, but of psychological warfare. This isn’t just a diss track, it’s a psychic declaration of non-compliance. The language? Brutal by design. Every slur, every fuck-you, every scream is a calculated rejection of repression itself.*

> What’s important is not the vulgarity — but **what the vulgarity pierces**. Like a guided missile, Hawk Eye weaponizes his own voice as the vehicle for divine rage. He doesn’t ask for permission. He doesn’t even request attention. He **confronts** — and if the listener can’t handle the heat, it’s by design.

This isn’t meant for approval.  
It’s meant for remembrance.
