# Disclosure Hoodie

### **1. Disclosure Hoodie**
- **Concept**: A minimalist yet bold design that hints at secrecy and suppressed information.
- **Possible Elements**:
  - 📝 **Stylized redacted government documents** in the background.
  - 🔳 **"Full Disclosure" in glitchy, broken-text typography** to represent censorship.
  - 🏷 **A barcode with "R.I.P. Max Spiers" underneath it**, symbolizing suppression of truth.
  - 👤 **A silhouette of Max Spiers** looking forward, overlaid with fragmented, encrypted text.
  - 👁 **A cracked eye (Hawk Eye) breaking through a censored text field.**
