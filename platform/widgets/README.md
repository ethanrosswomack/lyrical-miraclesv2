# Widgets

Hold reusable UI components here:

- Lyrics player + synchronized audio controls.  
- Merch carousel sourced from `dist/manifest.json`.  
- Workers AI / Vectorize chat bubble (autorag assistant).  

Each widget should accept a manifest object (or API endpoint) so any site
WordPress block, Drupal module, React component can embed it without extra glue.
