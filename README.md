# Lyrical Miracles v2 — EverLight Archive Backbone

This folder is the cleaned, future-facing version of the `lyrical-miracles` repo. It aligns the Hawk Eye catalog with the infrastructure plan from *The Omniversal Aether* so we can:  
- ship a Git-ready archive,  
- mirror all assets into Cloudflare R2 + D1 (or Postgres), and  
- feed CMS targets (WordPress, Ghost, Drupal, Astro/Next.js) plus Workers AI / AutoRAG pipelines.

```

## Quick Start
1. Drop or edit lyric markdown under `content/lyrics/releases/<release>/...`.  
2. Run `python scripts/normalize_assets.py` to enforce slug, metadata, and pointer consistency.  
3. Run `python scripts/build_manifest.py --out dist/manifest.json` to bundle lyrics, merch, media, and metadata into a single machine-readable document for CMS + AI ingestion.  
4. Upload binaries from `media/audio` + `media/images` to Cloudflare R2, saving the returned keys back into `dist/manifest.json`.  
5. Use `platform/exporters/*` to sync pages/posts into WordPress, Ghost, Drupal, or static builds.  
6. Trigger the Vectorize/AutoRAG ingest described in `docs/EverLights_autorag_guidebook.md`.

## Status
- Source materials imported from `~/lyrical-miracles/HAWK-ARS`.  
- TODO backlog copied into `docs/NEXTSTEPS_TODO.md`.  
- Scripts + docs are stubs—fill them out as we codify the pipeline.
