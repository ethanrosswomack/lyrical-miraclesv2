# EverLight's Rite: Full Disclosure (2020)

**Overview:**  
Written as a sequel to *Behold A Pale Horse*, this mixtape serves as a mirrored companion and spiritual download. The message isn’t hidden — it’s shouted from the rooftops. *Swordfish*, *Trafficked*, and *Syntax* are riddled with encoded transmissions for the initiated.

**Symbolism & Themes:**  
- 🧠 Mass Mind Control  
- 🕯️ Disclosure as both Warning and Sacrament  
- 🕷️ Unmasking Black Budget Projects

**Commentary:**  
There’s a ritualistic, chant-like frequency embedded in Hawk’s lyrical cadence here. Every rhyme scheme is carved with intention, exposing layers of narrative technology used against humanity.
