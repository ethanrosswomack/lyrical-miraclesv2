Yeah
For those of you unfamiliar, let me introduce myself
My name is Hawk Eye
And it ain't got shit to do with no comic book characters

I know you never heard of me, but bitch you are listening
To the wordsmith bird, who's lyrical witchery
Captivates your attention
I am the great intervention
You never saw this shit coming
But my statements are blistering
I'm invading the industry to create a new energy grid
And basically, I'm saying - I ain't playing, this is the end
Of mumble rap - I'm bringing back bundles of verbal attacks
Underhanded methods to subtly murder tracks
Witness how this hypnotist is wickedly gifted
With an ensemble of twisted words within his sentences
Its uncommon for a song or any written inscription
As intricate as I'm spitting to exist

Let me reintroduce you to my speaker abuse
I'm a god damn man too evil for Zeus
Thor, Hercules, and Odin, Horus, Isis, Anubis
Or Athena to extinguish rhyme schemes when I set them loose
Fire flowing like lava from my soul can revive
A dead world too cold, which no one can thrive in
I'm not going on surviving just to suffer and die
When I can be the change we need to see
A poet you vibe with

You've never heard of me, (Hi) but bitch you are listening
You've never heard of me, but bitch you are listening
To the wordsmith bird, who's lyrical witchery
Hi! - I know you've never heard of me, but bitch you are listening
To the oh - Wait - Yeah

I know you never heard me, but bitch you are listening

To the word smith bird, who's lyrical witchery

Hi, I know you've never heard of me, but bitch you are listening

To Hawk Eye - The wordsmith bird, who's lyrical witchery

Came to invoke religiously omnipotent wizardry

Through incantations spoken with intentional focus

This Hocus Pocus is so potent every poet you know

Is almost a joke when compared with how my word play keeps stoking

The fire inside your heart - My divinely inspired art

Comes from higher levels - I am the vessel here to impart

Linguistic mystical, rhythmic, prolific scripture intended

To make a dent in this wicked mind-controlling system's defense

As you listen, bear witness to this druidic hit list

Black magicians, politicians, and voodoo apprentices

Dark witches and morticians who assist them in rituals

And you spiritual officials molesting little kids - You're through

My tongue casts spells to lock you in hell

I'm binding demons when I'm singing - Couldn't you tell

You must be out your fucking mind or something

I'm not bluffing - My rhymes summon divine destruction

Holy retribution - Execution - Every method I am using

To remind you why I'm here again only seems to confuse you

So let me explain this shit again - I reincarnated just to resist

And Hi! - I know you never heard of me

I'm Hawk Eye

But bitch, you are listening to the wordsmith bird

With lyrical witchery

And I know you never heard of me

But Hi! - I'm Hawk Eye

And bitch, you are listening to the wordsmith bird

With lyrical witchery

I know you never heard of me

Hi!

But bitch, you are listening to the wordsmith bird

With lyrical witchery - Hawk Eye
