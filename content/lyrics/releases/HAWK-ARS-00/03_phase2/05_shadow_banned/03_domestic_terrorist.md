Yeah, what you know about this
I'm a domestic terrorist
And it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers
Cause I brought this heater
Just to delete you bitch
What you know about this
I'm a domestic terrorist

I thought I told you motherfuckers not once but twice
No vest can protect this will go right
Through your chest if you test me, best think twice
I am what the Feds won't arrest because I might
Serenade the industry with terroristic imagery
Lyrics which your Therapist apparently is listening
To, but you aren't embarrassed when he mentions me
In front of your parents - I swear it holds merits
Even authority figures admit
It's legit as it gets when I'm spitting this shit
Pastors, cops, lawyers, inmates and
Women let their children hear my demands
That you all finally stop playing this game
Mental matrix, this shit's insane
Go to work then to Church - Stay inert and invert
Everything about life, and ignore the hurt
But I am here to make sure you all wake up
Break the gameboard, fuck every state - You cunts
Don't get it yet - Isn't this nation made of
Imaginary rules some Magisterial
Judge in a back room, buzzed with a sack full
Of money and drugs - Stealing what he can as you
Tax slaves play along with it as
If this bullshit should exist

But what you know about this - I'm a domestic terrorist
And it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers
Cause I brought this heater just to delete you bitch

Yeah, what you know about this - I'm a domestic terrorist

And it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers

Cause I brought this heater, just to delete you bitch

Arbitrary ordinance - Everyday there's more of it

Policy enforced by violent little boys when

Sovereign human beings stop being obedient

Trigger-happy Officers immediately extinguish them

Systematic servitude coming through to murder who

Ever doesn't listen to this Christianized worldview

Holy war, Heaven's more wicked and you're too

Weak to compete - Stay asleep and ignore truth

I am what you fuck nuts hate to embrace

Too late - Can't escape - I'll erupt in your face

Pompeii - No wait - This is Sodom and Gomorrah

Every whore of Babylon, I tried to warn you

You reap what you sow or didn't you know

That you get what you give and even though

You repent of your sins, no mercy grows

Just serpentine word cursing flows

From my lips and they hit every inch of your shit

Energy grid - Locked by Divine Writ

The Word made flesh - God-like when this

Lyrical spell that I bind you with takes hold

You'll do just what you're told

Cause my soul is ancient and much too old

For your children to pretend I will not bend

Old men till they break and then unfold them again

Cause what you know about this, I'm a domestic terrorist

And it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers

Cause I brought this heater, just to delete you bitch

What you know about this, I'm a domestic terrorist

And it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers

Cause I brought this heater, just to delete you bitch

You motherfuckers ready? Cause when I flip

This switch every soul here will insist

Get a grip, this is it - You hear this shit

Let me show you bitches - No defense

Holds so when words, my lips unleash

Completely delete every single weak

Motherfucker I discover, just know

One way or another I'll show

The whole damn world that at my command

Every fucking man, woman, child, and

Soul enlisted to resist will stand

Unified by what's whispered in

Each ear I near - Come witness real

Quick how it feels when lyrics like this

Hit your shit and convince you this legit

Poetic imprint shouldn't even exist

Skills leveled this high, kills devils with pride

I ain't even trying, what the fuck would you guys

Even do If I just suddenly decided to attack

And actually come back and fuck up each side

Northwest, southeast - There's nothing you can find

To protect your neck - What I'm stuffing in your mind

Will connect and resurrect souls summoned by Divine

Time codes etched in the stars remind

Us of the cosmic clock we forgot -

So my rhythmic syllable configurations

Take the blind and give them eyes to see

Beyond this matrix

So what you know about this, I'm a domestic terrorist

Yeah, and it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers

Cause I brought this heater, just to delete you bitch

Yeah, what you know about this, I'm a domestic terrorist

And it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers

Cause I brought this heater, just to delete you bitch

Yeah what you know about this, I'm a domestic terrorist

And it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers

Cause I brought this heater, just to delete you bitch

What you know about this, I'm a

What you, what you,

What you know about this, I'm a

What you, what you, what you

What you know about this, I'm a domestic terrorist

Yeah, and it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers

Cause I brought this heater, just to delete you bitch

Just to delete you, bitch

What you know about this

I'm a domestic terrorist

Motherfuckers better shadow ban the shit out of this motherfucking album
