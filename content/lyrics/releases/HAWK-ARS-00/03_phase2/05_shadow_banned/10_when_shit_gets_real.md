Let me let you niggaz know
Let me let you - let me let you
Let me let you niggaz know
You been blinded by the show

Lemme let you niggaz know
You been blinded by the show
Hypnotized by the screen
And you're  Living in a dream world
No - I don't give a fuck how ya feel
Imma tell you what the deal is so
When shit gets real
You remember this flow
Let me let you niggaz know
Let me let you - let me let you
Let me let you niggaz know
You been blinded by the show
Hypnotized by the screen
And you're living in a dream world
So

My intentional offensive statements
May just make you hate me
I am well aware the things I'm saying
Go against the grain
And make it difficult to stomach
But it's necessary - Everywhere we turn
Another politician stresses very clear
We should fear shit that doesn't even exist and feel
Terrified of anyone questioning what's real
The Propaganda on the television is used to build
Artificial constructs - It's official - We're fucked
But I interrupt this broadcast
To bring you the raw facts
I am back and my attack
Has just begun - So relax

Before we get to business i insist you look around

And bear witness to the fact the world is upside down

Full Disclosure like I told ya - I'm the composer of these

Incantations - Move whole nations - Invokations low key

I am more than just a rapper - I'm a factor so mean

That the Devil is unsettled when my clever words bring

Ancient Magick to the battle no one else has ever seen

Savage Babble I unravel - wicked spell casting

Elemental forces coursing through

My being like endorphins

Bend reality around me and it sounds like this

Lemme let you niggaz know

You been blinded by the show

Hypnotized by the screen

And you're  Living in a dream world

No - I don't give a fuck how ya feel

Imma tell you what the deal is so

When shit gets real

You remember this flow

Let me let you niggaz know

Let me let you - let me let you

Let me let you niggaz know

You been blinded by the show

Hypnotized by the screen

And you're living in a dream world

So

Take a second to reflect

I don't want you to neglect

How insane everything became

After Jeffrey's death

One minute, people are demanding the truth

But in the next 30 seconds, Bio Weapons

Flood each section of the press

And most of you couldn't see what the fuck was going on

Now two years later I'm here writing this song

You dumbasses wearing masks still -  tryna push a Vax

Cuz the TV said to trust the science, but I have to ask

Did you forget that world leaders, billionaires and more

Traffick little kids as sex slaves, all over the spell casting

Epstein's little island was just one that got exposed

But they shut the planet down as a way to stop the flow

Of uncensored information, conversations that emerged

Asking why these news stations were insisting this absurd

Bullshit suicide narrative was being pushed

Oh Epstein died? Are you sure? Let's take a look

But before too many people started seeing all this evil

Suddenly a very lethal common cold stole our legal

System through persistent propaganda and upheavals

Of everybody's daily life to make sure all the sheeple

Complied with the lies, and tried to survive

A nonexistent pandemic which spread worldwide

Yeah sure, people died, but tell me something new

Don't pretend that raping kids isn't worse than the flu

Lemme let you niggaz know

You been blinded by the show

Hypnotized by the screen

And you're  Living in a dream world

No - I don't give a fuck how ya feel

Imma tell you what the deal is so

When shit gets real

You remember this flow

Let me let you niggaz know

Let me let you - let me let you

Let me let you niggaz know

You been blinded by the show

Hypnotized by the screen

And you're living in a dream world

So

In the Age of Deceit - God sent me to Preach

And wake the dead with my speech

I'm here to teach you, but I keep

Fucking up the cover up

I must be what the Upper Crust

Couldn't shove beneath the TV screen I busted

You're in luck

I'm something nothing can adjust

Bend, Break, Budge or Crush

My apologies but all I see is fake dumb stuff

I am really here to clear the field

And No One will prevent Me

Stand against me and you'll get to see

Why Enemies don't tempt the

Lord of War - not even Thor

Could bring enough Lightning - and sure

Odin knows he'd need the whole

Entire kingdom to move forward

But then an avalanche of happenstance

At my command would pour

I let a motherfucker dumb enough

Run up and touch the sun, I just

Summon every one to come

And humble 'em for me - I trust

Someone gets the message through

And stresses, if they test me too

Much I might combust into a supernova

What the fuck do you do then

Cause I'll obliterate and end

An entire Solar System

That's  how I unfold this Wisdom

From my lips and split the fabric of reality before

I enlisted to persist - #Reincarnated2Resist

That means I am why your violent ambitious bullshit

Only serves my Higher Purpose

Every Liar in this Circus

Isn't working for the Serpents

I disguised them - My Insurgents

Activate when I encourage

Sleeper Agents to awake

My Replacements take control

And Break the Matrix as a whole

Lemme let you niggaz know

You been blinded by the show

Hypnotized by the screen

And you're  Living in a dream world

No - I don't give a fuck how ya feel

Imma tell you what the deal is so

When shit gets real

You remember this flow

Let me let you niggaz know

Let me let you - let me let you

Let me let you niggaz know

You been blinded by the show

Hypnotized by the screen
