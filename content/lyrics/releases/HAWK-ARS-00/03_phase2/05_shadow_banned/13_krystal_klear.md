First things first - This entire fucking verse
Is like a murder weapon left in plain sight outside the church
And I reckon I could threaten everybody with this Hearse
I'm driving thru the crowded sections of my town in, it gets worse
If you question my methods - I'll infect you with a curse
That's too effective to correct - Nothing protects you when I work
It's evident when I commit the crimes the devil won't permit
There's several other fucking levels of hell where he ain't been
Now get your men together - Line 'em up - So I can knock 'em down
Apocalyptic Qaballistic wordsmithing that's too Profound
For you bitches to convince yourselves this Lyric isn't Bound
To bend reality around the beat - My Wizardry is now complete

To bend reality around the beat - My Wizardry is now complete

Linguistical mystical script that's Cryptic and Mythic
Whenever shit like this is written all of Heaven's enlisted
In assisting with specific information - Like listen
Did you know if you're a patient of mine your new prescription
Is wordplay competitions with competent comprehensive
Fully formed complex interesting new Sentences
All this wicked verbiage that you've heard this bird come deliver
Isn't just silly worded nonsensical lyric filler
I can say what I mean - However I want
The language reconstructs itself around the things that I've thought
So whenever I endeavor to say clever shit - Watch
How fluidly this Druid Speech then proceeds to concoct
Amazingly understandable easy concepts that flow
Together like I've only been gifted with Prose
I'm Rhyming lines that don't belong and making them into a song
How many times should I remind you I'm divine - Nothing's wrong

The sound you hear is Krystal Klear

And since it's Krystal Klear

I'm gonna keep pounding this shit in your Ear

My murder weapons on the steps I left to make you second guess

How belligerent I can get whenever someone tests

I can fix your curiosity - Come closer - I insist

The only interesting atrocities are ones that I commit

You think I'm bluffing - Won't do nothing

I'm just running my tongue but when

I'm confronted you suspect I'll play dumb or try something

To relieve the situation - But without any hesitation

I will take you out the Matrix, Neo - Death is only waiting

To awaken you to life - Don't worry, I might

Let you see another day - I'll let you live - Okay, I'm playing

Fuck around and find out what my Word is about

I'll take you out the fucking' picture

Then Immortalize in Scripture

Words that say - Here lies the Victim of a cataclysmic ending

He pretended he could weather the storm, but clearly didn't

Everybody take heed - I am who He

Underestimated - Does this say enough or do you need

Another lesson? Smith and Wesson M&P 9 stressing

Do not test what you cannot correct - I'm tryna be effective

Through your vest and out your chest my R.I.P. rounds aren't impressed

But I warned you plenty times, so bye again I guess

The sound you hear is Krystal Klear

It's

And since it's Krystal Klear that's why  I'm pounding this shit in your Ear

I'm never gonna stop dropping this hot prolific box

Of bars I forged in Dragon Fire - I am what you're not

I will build this cage, put you inside and throw away the key

And there's no way that even Superman could save you - He'll need

Another way to bend The Stationary, harder than steel

Diamond cut bars I made to enslave you - so chill

Once I decided to compile my writings no one could deal

With what I might say next - Or have left to say still

My intervention of this system is designed to find all entrances

Disable any defense mechanisms and replace them with

Our own secure defensive turrets - So we're sure that this insurgence

Overwhelms the opposition - Forcing their cooperative

Surrender, retreat, white flags and unique

Cries for mercy - No one working for me even blinks

No one here will get to see another sunrise

We are killing every motherfucker and their mothers too - Fucker
