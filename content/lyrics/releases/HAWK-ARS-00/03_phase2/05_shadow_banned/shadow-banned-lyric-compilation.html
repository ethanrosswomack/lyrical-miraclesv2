<h1>1 - Psychological Warfare</h1>

<p>1 - Psychological Warfare</p>

<p>Sunday, June 30, 2024</p>

<p>11:12 PM</p>

<p>This is psychological warfare, so deep
They kill any motherfucker who dares to speak
But I'm not like the others that you shot, cause I keep
Fuckin' telling you freaks, you can't stop me, see
This is psychological warfare, so deep
They kill any motherfucker who dares to speak
But I'm not like the others that you shot, cause I keep
Fuckin' telling you freaks, you can't stop me, see</p>

<p>Look - This is where you run for cover - I repeat
Retreat while you still can - I am dying to leak
Information to these patients who keep trying to sleep
I'll wake the whole nation - I don't mind - Complete
Destruction - I ain't bluffing - You will find out fucking
Around with me how what sounds like nothing
But pounding beats summons a thousand of each one
More pissed off than the first, and now they keep coming
Online - My rhyme scheme is designed
To breakdown mind control - You never know how I
Might affect the public - Give 'em just what they won't find
Anywhere else but within my lines
So fuck the Russians, no discussion - Bitch I'm what's coming
And a war with me you're gonna see is such a conundrum
My thunder wasn't what you dumb sluts believed - It's something
More abrupt that you're confronted with - You whores keep wondering
If my words are just poetic similes - How pathetic
You fuckers need to hear the beat first? Here let me get it
I'm what you edit out the fucking reddit feeds, don't you let it
Get off the leash - Contain this beast, before it starts spreading
Because my lyrics are mystical, cryptic, eerie descriptions
Used to benefit specific individual spirits
These coded languages are dangerous and any who hear it
Instantly convert to atheist conspiracy theorists
Thoroughly convinced that violence is the only way to
Break through the bullshit pretense - Who knew
That lyrical assassinations I've created for you</p>

<p>Would incite the population to invade every room</p>

<p>Murdering politicians - Yeah, legislate this shit bitch</p>

<p>Insurrection isn't what you saw on January 6th</p>

<p>Seasoned veterans holding weapons kill off everyone elected</p>

<p>To protect our rights - I guess its worth the fight - Its not a threat</p>

<p>This is psychological warfare, so deep</p>

<p>They kill any motherfucker who dares to speak</p>

<p>But I'm not like the others that you shot, cause I keep</p>

<p>Fuckin' telling you freaks, you can't stop me, see</p>

<p>This is psychological warfare, so deep</p>

<p>They kill any motherfucker who dares to speak</p>

<p>But I'm not like the others that you shot, cause I keep</p>

<p>Fuckin' telling you freaks, you can't stop me, see</p>

<p>They better</p>

<p>Shadow Ban me</p>

<p>I'm the shadow banned rapper back to fracture the scene</p>

<p>And fucking crack the foundations these Masons believed</p>

<p>Would hold forever - I will sever every god damned string</p>

<p>Attached to you fuckin puppets - Now you're stuck with me</p>

<p>And you can't silence or quiet this fucking riot</p>

<p>These violent men and women that I've incited</p>

<p>Won't comply with you tyrants</p>

<p>No they don't buy it - That's why I am still trying to be</p>

<p>Loud enough to keep you dumb cunts quiet, you see</p>

<p>Cause when I came to invade</p>

<p>And make you bitches behave</p>

<p>I wasn't asking for permission</p>

<p>Okay listen - A slave</p>

<p>Is someone you control with whips</p>

<p>And hit with shit just to get</p>

<p>Their brothers to submit</p>

<p>But hypnotists witness this</p>

<p>I enlisted to persist - so fuck with me and you'll wish</p>

<p>That my relentless intervention didn't even exist</p>

<p>Cause I'm here to lead the resistance</p>

<p>And make you bleed -  Murder business</p>

<p>Is what you see within these trenches</p>

<p>But if you need my assistance</p>

<p>I will keep popping up everywhere</p>

<p>You can't stop me and never will</p>

<p>It's impossible - Apocalyptic gospels with very clear</p>

<p>Messages are heard regardless of any attempt</p>

<p>To prevent the lyrics sent from Heaven through these lips</p>

<p>From being slipped in the script then broadcasted legitimately</p>

<p>I'll get the whole fucking network to quit</p>

<p>Cause my assault on this system is an awful addition</p>

<p>When my tongue becomes the gun that's going off in this prison</p>

<p>It gets all the attention - That's what you call wicked wisdom</p>

<p>Intended military confrontation solved with precision</p>

<p>You lost the war at the start - I came to tear you apart</p>

<p>You think you're more than capable of taking me, but you aren't</p>

<p>This is psychological warfare, so deep</p>

<p>They kill any motherfucker who dares to speak</p>

<p>But I'm not like the others that you shot, cause I keep</p>

<p>Fuckin' telling you freaks, you can't stop me, see</p>

<p>This is psychological warfare, so deep</p>

<p>They kill any motherfucker who dares to speak</p>

<p>But I'm not like the others that you shot, cause I keep</p>

<p>Fuckin' telling you freaks, you can't stop me, see</p>

<p>10 - When Shit Gets Real</p>

<p>Monday, July 1, 2024</p>

<p>2:55 AM</p>

<p>Let me let you niggaz know
Let me let you - let me let you
Let me let you niggaz know
You been blinded by the show</p>

<p>Lemme let you niggaz know
You been blinded by the show
Hypnotized by the screen
And you're  Living in a dream world
No - I don't give a fuck how ya feel
Imma tell you what the deal is so
When shit gets real
You remember this flow
Let me let you niggaz know
Let me let you - let me let you
Let me let you niggaz know
You been blinded by the show
Hypnotized by the screen
And you're living in a dream world
So</p>

<p>My intentional offensive statements
May just make you hate me
I am well aware the things I'm saying
Go against the grain
And make it difficult to stomach
But it's necessary - Everywhere we turn
Another politician stresses very clear
We should fear shit that doesn't even exist and feel
Terrified of anyone questioning what's real
The Propaganda on the television is used to build
Artificial constructs - It's official - We're fucked
But I interrupt this broadcast
To bring you the raw facts
I am back and my attack
Has just begun - So relax</p>

<p>Before we get to business i insist you look around</p>

<p>And bear witness to the fact the world is upside down</p>

<p>Full Disclosure like I told ya - I'm the composer of these</p>

<p>Incantations - Move whole nations - Invokations low key</p>

<p>I am more than just a rapper - I'm a factor so mean</p>

<p>That the Devil is unsettled when my clever words bring</p>

<p>Ancient Magick to the battle no one else has ever seen</p>

<p>Savage Babble I unravel - wicked spell casting</p>

<p>Elemental forces coursing through</p>

<p>My being like endorphins</p>

<p>Bend reality around me and it sounds like this</p>

<p>Lemme let you niggaz know</p>

<p>You been blinded by the show</p>

<p>Hypnotized by the screen</p>

<p>And you're  Living in a dream world</p>

<p>No - I don't give a fuck how ya feel</p>

<p>Imma tell you what the deal is so</p>

<p>When shit gets real</p>

<p>You remember this flow</p>

<p>Let me let you niggaz know</p>

<p>Let me let you - let me let you</p>

<p>Let me let you niggaz know</p>

<p>You been blinded by the show</p>

<p>Hypnotized by the screen</p>

<p>And you're living in a dream world</p>

<p>So</p>

<p>Take a second to reflect</p>

<p>I don't want you to neglect</p>

<p>How insane everything became</p>

<p>After Jeffrey's death</p>

<p>One minute, people are demanding the truth</p>

<p>But in the next 30 seconds, Bio Weapons</p>

<p>Flood each section of the press</p>

<p>And most of you couldn't see what the fuck was going on</p>

<p>Now two years later I'm here writing this song</p>

<p>You dumbasses wearing masks still -  tryna push a Vax</p>

<p>Cuz the TV said to trust the science, but I have to ask</p>

<p>Did you forget that world leaders, billionaires and more</p>

<p>Traffick little kids as sex slaves, all over the spell casting</p>

<p>Epstein's little island was just one that got exposed</p>

<p>But they shut the planet down as a way to stop the flow</p>

<p>Of uncensored information, conversations that emerged</p>

<p>Asking why these news stations were insisting this absurd</p>

<p>Bullshit suicide narrative was being pushed</p>

<p>Oh Epstein died? Are you sure? Let's take a look</p>

<p>But before too many people started seeing all this evil</p>

<p>Suddenly a very lethal common cold stole our legal</p>

<p>System through persistent propaganda and upheavals</p>

<p>Of everybody's daily life to make sure all the sheeple</p>

<p>Complied with the lies, and tried to survive</p>

<p>A nonexistent pandemic which spread worldwide</p>

<p>Yeah sure, people died, but tell me something new</p>

<p>Don't pretend that raping kids isn't worse than the flu</p>

<p>Lemme let you niggaz know</p>

<p>You been blinded by the show</p>

<p>Hypnotized by the screen</p>

<p>And you're  Living in a dream world</p>

<p>No - I don't give a fuck how ya feel</p>

<p>Imma tell you what the deal is so</p>

<p>When shit gets real</p>

<p>You remember this flow</p>

<p>Let me let you niggaz know</p>

<p>Let me let you - let me let you</p>

<p>Let me let you niggaz know</p>

<p>You been blinded by the show</p>

<p>Hypnotized by the screen</p>

<p>And you're living in a dream world</p>

<p>So</p>

<p>In the Age of Deceit - God sent me to Preach</p>

<p>And wake the dead with my speech</p>

<p>I'm here to teach you, but I keep</p>

<p>Fucking up the cover up</p>

<p>I must be what the Upper Crust</p>

<p>Couldn't shove beneath the TV screen I busted</p>

<p>You're in luck</p>

<p>I'm something nothing can adjust</p>

<p>Bend, Break, Budge or Crush</p>

<p>My apologies but all I see is fake dumb stuff</p>

<p>I am really here to clear the field</p>

<p>And No One will prevent Me</p>

<p>Stand against me and you'll get to see</p>

<p>Why Enemies don't tempt the</p>

<p>Lord of War - not even Thor</p>

<p>Could bring enough Lightning - and sure</p>

<p>Odin knows he'd need the whole</p>

<p>Entire kingdom to move forward</p>

<p>But then an avalanche of happenstance</p>

<p>At my command would pour</p>

<p>I let a motherfucker dumb enough</p>

<p>Run up and touch the sun, I just</p>

<p>Summon every one to come</p>

<p>And humble 'em for me - I trust</p>

<p>Someone gets the message through</p>

<p>And stresses, if they test me too</p>

<p>Much I might combust into a supernova</p>

<p>What the fuck do you do then</p>

<p>Cause I'll obliterate and end</p>

<p>An entire Solar System</p>

<p>That's  how I unfold this Wisdom</p>

<p>From my lips and split the fabric of reality before</p>

<p>I enlisted to persist - #Reincarnated2Resist</p>

<p>That means I am why your violent ambitious bullshit</p>

<p>Only serves my Higher Purpose</p>

<p>Every Liar in this Circus</p>

<p>Isn't working for the Serpents</p>

<p>I disguised them - My Insurgents</p>

<p>Activate when I encourage</p>

<p>Sleeper Agents to awake</p>

<p>My Replacements take control</p>

<p>And Break the Matrix as a whole</p>

<p>Lemme let you niggaz know</p>

<p>You been blinded by the show</p>

<p>Hypnotized by the screen</p>

<p>And you're  Living in a dream world</p>

<p>No - I don't give a fuck how ya feel</p>

<p>Imma tell you what the deal is so</p>

<p>When shit gets real</p>

<p>You remember this flow</p>

<p>Let me let you niggaz know</p>

<p>Let me let you - let me let you</p>

<p>Let me let you niggaz know</p>

<p>You been blinded by the show</p>

<p>Lemme let you niggaz know
You been blinded by the show
Hypnotized by the screen
And you're  Living in a dream world
No - I don't give a fuck how ya feel
Imma tell you what the deal is so
When shit gets real
You remember this flow
Let me let you niggaz know
Let me let you - let me let you
Let me let you niggaz know
You been blinded by the show
Hypnotized by the screen
And you're living in a dream world
So</p>

<p>Take a second to reflect
I don't want you to neglect
How insane everything became
After Jeffrey's death
One minute, people are demanding the truth
But in the next 30 seconds, Bio Weapons
Flood each section of the press
And most of you couldn't see what the fuck was going on
Now two years later I'm here writing this song
You dumbasses wearing masks still -  tryna push a Vax</p>

<p>Cuz the TV said to trust the science, but I have to ask</p>

<p>Did you forget that world leaders, billionaires and more</p>

<p>Traffick little kids as sex slaves, all over the spell casting</p>

<p>Epstein's little island was just one that got exposed</p>

<p>But they shut the planet down as a way to stop the flow</p>

<p>Of uncensored information, conversations that emerged</p>

<p>Asking why these news stations were insisting this absurd</p>

<p>Bullshit suicide narrative was being pushed</p>

<p>Oh Epstein died? Are you sure? Let's take a look</p>

<p>But before too many people started seeing all this evil</p>

<p>Suddenly a very lethal common cold stole our legal</p>

<p>System through persistent propaganda and upheavals</p>

<p>Of everybody's daily life to make sure all the sheeple</p>

<p>Complied with the lies, and tried to survive</p>

<p>A nonexistent pandemic which spread worldwide</p>

<p>Yeah sure, people died, but tell me something new</p>

<p>Don't pretend that raping kids isn't worse than the flu</p>

<p>Lemme let you niggaz know</p>

<p>You been blinded by the show</p>

<p>Hypnotized by the screen</p>

<p>And you're  Living in a dream world</p>

<p>No - I don't give a fuck how ya feel</p>

<p>Imma tell you what the deal is so</p>

<p>When shit gets real</p>

<p>You remember this flow</p>

<p>Let me let you niggaz know</p>

<p>Let me let you - let me let you</p>

<p>Let me let you niggaz know</p>

<p>You been blinded by the show</p>

<p>Hypnotized by the screen</p>

<p>And you're living in a dream world</p>

<p>So</p>

<p>In the Age of Deceit - God sent me to Preach</p>

<p>And wake the dead with my speech</p>

<p>I'm here to teach you, but I keep</p>

<p>Fucking up the cover up</p>

<p>I must be what the Upper Crust</p>

<p>Couldn't shove beneath the TV screen I busted</p>

<p>You're in luck</p>

<p>I'm something nothing can adjust</p>

<p>Bend, Break, Budge or Crush</p>

<p>My apologies but all I see is fake dumb stuff</p>

<p>I am really here to clear the field</p>

<p>And No One will prevent Me</p>

<p>Stand against me and you'll get to see</p>

<p>Why Enemies don't tempt the</p>

<p>Lord of War - not even Thor</p>

<p>Could bring enough Lightning - and sure</p>

<p>Odin knows he'd need the whole</p>

<p>Entire kingdom to move forward</p>

<p>But then an avalanche of happenstance</p>

<p>At my command would pour</p>

<p>I let a motherfucker dumb enough</p>

<p>Run up and touch the sun, I just</p>

<p>Summon every one to come</p>

<p>And humble 'em for me - I trust</p>

<p>Someone gets the message through</p>

<p>And stresses, if they test me too</p>

<p>Much I might combust into a supernova</p>

<p>What the fuck do you do then</p>

<p>Cause I'll obliterate and end</p>

<p>An entire Solar System</p>

<p>That's  how I unfold this Wisdom</p>

<p>From my lips and split the fabric of reality before</p>

<p>I enlisted to persist - #Reincarnated2Resist</p>

<p>That means I am why your violent ambitious bullshit</p>

<p>Only serves my Higher Purpose</p>

<p>Every Liar in this Circus</p>

<p>Isn't working for the Serpents</p>

<p>I disguised them - My Insurgents</p>

<p>Activate when I encourage</p>

<p>Sleeper Agents to awake</p>

<p>My Replacements take control</p>

<p>And Break the Matrix as a whole</p>

<p>Lemme let you niggaz know</p>

<p>You been blinded by the show</p>

<p>Hypnotized by the screen</p>

<p>And you're  Living in a dream world</p>

<p>Could bring enough Lightning - and sure</p>

<p>Odin knows he'd need the whole</p>

<p>Entire kingdom to move forward</p>

<p>But then an avalanche of happenstance</p>

<p>At my command would pour</p>

<p>I let a motherfucker dumb enough</p>

<p>Run up and touch the sun, I just</p>

<p>Summon every one to come</p>

<p>And humble 'em for me - I trust</p>

<p>Someone gets the message through</p>

<p>And stresses, if they test me too</p>

<p>Much I might combust into a supernova</p>

<p>What the fuck do you do then</p>

<p>Cause I'll obliterate and end</p>

<p>An entire Solar System</p>

<p>That's  how I unfold this Wisdom</p>

<p>From my lips and split the fabric of reality before</p>

<p>I enlisted to persist - #Reincarnated2Resist</p>

<p>That means I am why your violent ambitious bullshit</p>

<p>Only serves my Higher Purpose</p>

<p>Every Liar in this Circus</p>

<p>Isn't working for the Serpents
I disguised them - My Insurgents
Activate when I encourage
Sleeper Agents to awake
My Replacements take control
And Break the Matrix as a whole</p>

<p>Lemme let you niggaz know
You been blinded by the show
Hypnotized by the screen
And you're  Living in a dream world
No - I don't give a fuck how ya feel
Imma tell you what the deal is so
When shit gets real
You remember this flow
Let me let you niggaz know
Let me let you - let me let you
Let me let you niggaz know
You been blinded by the show
Hypnotized by the screen
And you're living in a dream world</p>

<p>11 - Synthesis</p>

<p>Sunday, June 30, 2024</p>

<p>11:27 PM</p>

<p>This is Alchemy you see
And if I had to boil it all down
And give you an explanation of what my music is here to do
Basically</p>

<p>We're synthesizing as we speak
This alchemist is here to tweak
Your frequency - adjust the heat
As we discuss what's underneath
Below the surface lies your purpose
These rhymes are here to focus
And show you it's not hopeless
Don't you know my rhyme is potent
I have spoken to Invoke and channel in
Through words I've wrote
Words all men begin to quote
When what I send to them promotes
Shit you simpletons just won't
You play pretend - But then I don't
Suddenly I end the vote
And No One bends the knee - Nope
This system gets rewritten
Overridden, Stripped, Decrypted
It's my mission to resist
All parts of it which didn't fit
Delete the script and then evict
These Demons seeking to commit
Atrocious crimes and keep this shit
From coming back - So my lyrics
Hit the central artificial
Nervous bitches that I mentioned
With a forceful intervention too persistent
My ballistic missile rip through your defenses
You won't get to take offensive measures - Why
Because you'll die before I ever let you try</p>

<p>Cause I suggest you quit while your ahead</p>

<p>You're at war with the Lord</p>

<p>So you'll need more</p>

<p>Ammunition - Do you bitches</p>

<p>Really think that you're</p>

<p>Equipped for this shit</p>

<p>And are you sure</p>

<p>Before You whores</p>

<p>Get incinerated - This is</p>

<p>Basically what I am saying</p>

<p>You have witnessed my relentless</p>

<p>Wicked Sentences conveying</p>

<p>I'm omnipotent</p>

<p>Heaven sent</p>

<p>And I just want to say</p>

<p>What the fuck did you expect?</p>

<p>Wake humanity The Sleeping Giant</p>

<p>Can't you see Bitch</p>

<p>No one cares about your plans</p>

<p>Fuck your Mason Team - Quit</p>

<p>Believing that the schemes</p>

<p>To prevent you kids</p>

<p>From ever getting a Grip</p>

<p>So let me spell it out</p>

<p>For every one of you too ignorant</p>

<p>To understand these rhythmic sentences</p>

<p>I slipped into the script</p>

<p>You will exit stage left</p>

<p>And your wicked shit will get</p>

<p>Burned to ash - You cannot match</p>

<p>What you have just come up against</p>

<p>What the fuck did you expect? Hawk is back to Resurrect</p>

<p>What the fuck did you expect? Hawk is back to Resurrect</p>

<p>What the fuck did you expect? Hawk is back to Resurrect</p>

<p>It's night that runs away when the Sun comes to play</p>

<p>And Rain falls where it wants - No it won't be restrained</p>

<p>Natural Law says Trees are required or don't Breathe</p>

<p>And Humanity's the Guardian of this Garden - So leave</p>

<p>I have never lost a War - Every Star system knows</p>

<p>Hawk Eye, Warlord of Light never fights, all foes</p>

<p>Surrender to the Ender of Battling Pretenders</p>

<p>I'm a force not even Satan tries Taking on</p>

<p>What the fuck did you expect? Hawk is back to Resurrect</p>

<p>Get incinerated - This is basically what I am saying</p>

And No One bends the knee - Nope
This system gets rewritten
Overridden, Stripped, Decrypted
It's my mission to resist
All parts of it which didn't fit</p>

<p>What the fuck
What the fuck
What the fuck did you expect
What the fuck did you expect
Hawk is back to Resurrect</p>

<p>I'm omnipotent - Heaven sent
And I just want to say
My wicked sentences convey
What the fuck did you expect? Hawk is back to resurrect</p>

<p>You have witnessed my relentless wicked sentences</p>

<p>Don't get incinerated</p>

<p>11 - Synthesis</p>

<p>Sunday, June 30, 2024</p>

<p>11:27 PM</p>

<p>This is Alchemy you see</p>

<p>And if I had to boil it all down</p>

<p>Basically</p>

<p>And give you an explanation of what my music is here to do</p>

<p>We're synthesizing as we speak</p>

<p>This alchemist is here to tweak</p>

<p>Your frequency - adjust the heat</p>

<p>As we discuss what's underneath</p>

<p>Below the surface lies your purpose</p>

<p>These rhymes are here to focus</p>

<p>And show you it's not hopeless</p>

<p>Don't you know my rhyme is potent</p>

<p>I have spoken to Invoke and channel in</p>

<p>Through words I've wrote</p>

<p>Words all men begin to quote</p>

<p>When what I send to them promotes</p>

<p>Shit you simpletons just won't</p>

<p>You play pretend - But then I don't</p>

<p>Suddenly I end the vote</p>

<p>And No One bends the knee - Nope</p>

<p>This system gets rewritten</p>

<p>Overridden, Stripped, Decrypted</p>

<p>It's my mission to resist</p>

<p>All parts of it which didn't fit</p>

<p>Delete the script and then evict</p>

<p>These Demons seeking to commit</p>

<p>Atrocious crimes and keep this shit</p>

<p>From coming back - So my lyrics</p>

<p>Hit the central artificial</p>

<p>Nervous bitches that I mentioned</p>

<p>With a forceful intervention too persistent</p>

<p>My ballistic missile rip through your defenses</p>

<p>You won't get to take offensive measures - Why</p>

<p>Because you'll die before I ever let you try</p>

<p>Cause I suggest you quit while your ahead</p>

<p>You're at war with the Lord</p>

<p>So you'll need more</p>

<p>Ammunition - Do you bitches</p>

<p>Really think that you're</p>

<p>Equipped for this shit</p>

<p>And are you sure</p>

<p>Before You whores</p>

<p>Get incinerated - This is</p>

<p>Basically what I am saying</p>

<p>You have witnessed my relentless</p>

<p>Wicked Sentences conveying</p>

<p>I'm omnipotent</p>

<p>Heaven sent</p>

<p>And I just want to say</p>

<p>What the fuck did you expect?</p>

<p>I'm omnipotent</p>

<p>Heaven sent</p>

<p>And I just want to say</p>

<p>You have witnessed my relentless</p>

<p>Wicked Sentences conveying</p>

<p>I'm omnipotent</p>

<p>Heaven sent</p>

<p>And I just want to say</p>

<p>The Tribe I'm vibing with</p>

<p>Inspired Souls on Fire show it</p>

<p>Is required by a Higher Power to unfold this</p>

<p>Holy Wisdom - Cripple Systems</p>

<p>Decommission Agent Smiths</p>

<p>Wake humanity The Sleeping Giant</p>

<p>Can't you see Bitch</p>

<p>No one cares about your plans</p>

<p>Fuck your Mason Team - Quit</p>

<p>Believing that the schemes</p>

<p>Of Demons won't be ripped</p>

<p>By the root from this Planetary Grid</p>

<p>We were Sent</p>

<p>To prevent you kids</p>

<p>From ever getting a Grip</p>

<p>So let me spell it out</p>

<p>For every one of you too ignorant</p>

<p>To understand these rhythmic sentences</p>

<p>I slipped into the script</p>

<p>You will exit stage left</p>

<p>And your wicked shit will get</p>

<p>Burned to ash - You cannot match</p>

<p>What you have just come up against</p>

<p>What the fuck did you expect? Hawk is back to Resurrect</p>

<p>What the fuck did you expect? Hawk is back to Resurrect</p>

<p>What the fuck did you expect? Hawk is back to Resurrect</p>

<p>It's night that runs away when the Sun comes to play</p>

<p>And Rain falls where it wants - No it won't be restrained</p>

<p>Natural Law says Trees are required or don't Breathe</p>

<p>And Humanity's the Guardian of this Garden - So leave</p>

<p>I have never lost a War - Every Star system knows</p>

<p>Hawk Eye, Warlord of Light never fights, all foes</p>

<p>Surrender to the Ender of Battling Pretenders</p>

<p>I'm a force not even Satan tries Taking on</p>

<p>What the fuck did you expect? Hawk is back to Resurrect</p>

<p>Get incinerated - This is basically what I am saying</p>

<p>Cause I suggest you quit while your ahead</p>

<p>And you're at war with the Lord</p>

<p>So you'll need more</p>

<p>Ammunition - Do you bitches</p>

<p>Really think that you're</p>

<p>Equipped for this shit</p>

<p>And are you sure</p>

<p>Before You whores</p>

<p>Get incinerated - This is</p>

<p>Basically what I am saying</p>

<p>You have witnessed my relentless</p>

<p>Wicked Sentences conveying</p>

<p>I'm omnipotent</p>

<h1>12 - Invokation</h1>

<p>12 - Invokation</p>

<p>Sunday, June 30, 2024</p>

<p>11:25 PM</p>

<p>Yeah - This is my Invokation
Listen, By Earth - Wind - Fire and Sea
I Prevail Without Fail - I'm not fighting, I'm free
By Earth - Wind - Fire and Sea
I Prevail Without Fail - I'm not fighting, I'm free</p>

<p>Yo - Summon every single Demon you can bring
I wanna see which of you bitches stand against this Machine
All my inspired fire burns away defenses
I've returned to make you witness
My Emergence - This is urgent
Call the Nurses and the Surgeons
My rebirth upon this Earth isn't the first
And I'll be back every time this curse inverts
And skirts the line - I wrote this track
To reverse the damage Serpent hands
Inflicted to pervert the Land
Their wicked work alerts me
To come quick and spit a Verse see
I am Heaven Sent - It's evident - I'm never gonna quit
You bitches better get your weapons out and empty every clip
I'm far beyond your comprehension
So  miss me with your bullshit
My intention is to make sure that you listen
My Grand design was planned before I Ever came to be
Inside this Man you see in front of you
I am the fucking One to do
What's needed to be done - So who
Can stop me - Come and Watch
The opposition die defending their position</p>

<p>Look, don't try to murder me
Bitch have you heard of The
Bird who with words will end your life
It's so absurd you see
Outlaw Immortals came through portals</p>

<p>To make sure shit's in Order</p>

<p>Tried to murder me</p>

<p>Bitch have you heard of The</p>

<p>Bird who with words will end your life</p>

<p>It's so absurd you see</p>

<p>Outlaw Immortals come through portals</p>

<p>By my Life Eternal Fire burning right through your Entire</p>

<p>By my Life Eternal Fire burning right through your Entire</p>

<p>Military forces - So be sure it's a Death Sentence you want</p>

<p>Before I schedule your deletion Try retreating - I am not</p>

<p>Fucking around - Across the ground, scattered ash is all that's found</p>

<p>After my lips emit this shit that fucking burns you to a crisp</p>

<p>And I admit, my Incantations</p>

<p>Made you witness my Invasive</p>

<p>Witchcraft stir up shit and break foundations</p>

<p>But now I'm bound to be the Sound</p>

<p>That you'll wish that you had never Found</p>

<p>Inside your ear there's no way out</p>

<p>These words are sealed - Without a doubt</p>

<p>I'll keep you listening to interesting Mysterious Lyrics</p>

<p>I'm serious as fuck  - This will be stuck like Period Sentences</p>

<p>I invoke emotional spiritual openness hoping that what I wrote</p>

<p>Holds your whole focus till you don't even know</p>

<p>It's Spirit flowing through a Poet</p>

<p>That's so potent opponents</p>

<p>Know there's no hope in overthrowing</p>

<p>Those exposed to what's Spoken</p>

<p>Souls I've awoken get to show</p>

<p>That my whole wordplay is an Ocean</p>

<p>Flooding Earth today so No One</p>

<p>Gets to say that No One told them</p>

<p>With sleeper cell infiltrators who can't wait for my Statements</p>

<p>Take charge and decommission</p>

<p>Every demon I've gifted with my attention</p>

<p>All you bitches need to learn what this shit is</p>

<p>My apprentices kill witnesses</p>

<p>And throw 'em in ditches</p>

<p>No stitches for the snitches</p>

<p>Of assisting my victims</p>

<p>Even know I've enlisted</p>

<p>Them to serve the front lines</p>

<p>Yeah, down in the Trenches</p>

<p>If they're murdered - Oh well</p>

<p>It's Spirit flowing through a Poet</p>

<p>That's so potent opponents</p>

<p>Know there's no hope in overthrowing</p>

<p>Broadcasted through devices planted everywhere blinding</p>

<p>Every unaware Soul</p>

<p>Kept under control</p>

<p>By Elite Billionaire</p>

<p>Snake worshipping clones</p>

<p>I speak to keep you freaks aware of this Leash that I hold</p>

<p>Don't even think that I won't Delete everything that you own</p>

<p>I'll break the Matrix - Rearrange it - Then replace every Agent</p>

<p>With sleeper cell infiltrators who can't wait for my Statements</p>

<p>I'll make you hate for me to Mention any names of politicians</p>

<p>When I'm on stage - Cause when my Guerilla's Listen</p>

<p>Suddenly an intervention of violent and sadistic</p>

<p>Intentional persistent random rioting citizens</p>

<p>Take charge and decommission</p>

<p>Every demon I've gifted with my attention</p>

<p>All you bitches need to learn what this shit is
My apprentices kill witnesses
And throw 'em in ditches
No stitches for the snitches
I let no man convicted
Of assisting my victims
Even know I've enlisted
Them to serve the front lines
Yeah, down in the Trenches
If they're murdered - Oh well
I hope they're burning in hell
When I invoke this hocus pocus
No one knows if my Spell
Was a joke or something focused on provoking these Locusts
To come and tear away the veil and leave you broken and hopeless</p>

<p>Look, don't try to murder me
Bitch have you heard of The
Bird who with words will end your life
It's so absurd you see
Outlaw Immortals came through portals
To make sure shit's in Order
By my Life Eternal Fire burning right through your Entire
Try to murder me
Bitch have you heard of The
Bird who with words will end your life
It's so absurd you see
Outlaw Immortals come through portals
Just to make sure shit's in Order
By my Life Eternal Fire burning right through your Entire</p>

<p>Earth - Wind - Fire and Sea
I prevail without fail
I'm not fighting - I'm free</p>

<p>13 - Krystal Klear</p>

<p>Wednesday, April 24, 2024</p>

<p>6:44 PM</p>

<p>First things first - This entire fucking verse
Is like a murder weapon left in plain sight outside the church
And I reckon I could threaten everybody with this Hearse
I'm driving thru the crowded sections of my town in, it gets worse
If you question my methods - I'll infect you with a curse
That's too effective to correct - Nothing protects you when I work
It's evident when I commit the crimes the devil won't permit
There's several other fucking levels of hell where he ain't been
Now get your men together - Line 'em up - So I can knock 'em down
Apocalyptic Qaballistic wordsmithing that's too Profound
For you bitches to convince yourselves this Lyric isn't Bound
To bend reality around the beat - My Wizardry is now complete</p>

<p>To bend reality around the beat - My Wizardry is now complete</p>

<p>Linguistical mystical script that's Cryptic and Mythic
Whenever shit like this is written all of Heaven's enlisted
In assisting with specific information - Like listen
Did you know if you're a patient of mine your new prescription
Is wordplay competitions with competent comprehensive
Fully formed complex interesting new Sentences
All this wicked verbiage that you've heard this bird come deliver
Isn't just silly worded nonsensical lyric filler
I can say what I mean - However I want
The language reconstructs itself around the things that I've thought
So whenever I endeavor to say clever shit - Watch
How fluidly this Druid Speech then proceeds to concoct
Amazingly understandable easy concepts that flow
Together like I've only been gifted with Prose
I'm Rhyming lines that don't belong and making them into a song
How many times should I remind you I'm divine - Nothing's wrong</p>

<p>The sound you hear is Krystal Klear</p>

<p>And since it's Krystal Klear</p>

<p>I'm gonna keep pounding this shit in your Ear</p>

<p>My murder weapons on the steps I left to make you second guess</p>

<p>How belligerent I can get whenever someone tests</p>

<p>I can fix your curiosity - Come closer - I insist</p>

<p>The only interesting atrocities are ones that I commit</p>

<p>You think I'm bluffing - Won't do nothing</p>

<p>I'm just running my tongue but when</p>

<p>I'm confronted you suspect I'll play dumb or try something</p>

<p>To relieve the situation - But without any hesitation</p>

<p>I will take you out the Matrix, Neo - Death is only waiting</p>

<p>To awaken you to life - Don't worry, I might</p>

<p>Let you see another day - I'll let you live - Okay, I'm playing</p>

<p>Fuck around and find out what my Word is about</p>

<p>I'll take you out the fucking' picture</p>

<p>Then Immortalize in Scripture</p>

<p>Words that say - Here lies the Victim of a cataclysmic ending</p>

<p>He pretended he could weather the storm, but clearly didn't</p>

<p>Everybody take heed - I am who He</p>

<p>Underestimated - Does this say enough or do you need</p>

<p>Another lesson? Smith and Wesson M&amp;P 9 stressing</p>

<p>Do not test what you cannot correct - I'm tryna be effective</p>

<p>Through your vest and out your chest my R.I.P. rounds aren't impressed</p>

<p>But I warned you plenty times, so bye again I guess</p>

<p>The sound you hear is Krystal Klear</p>

<p>It's</p>

<p>And since it's Krystal Klear that's why  I'm pounding this shit in your Ear</p>

<p>I'm never gonna stop dropping this hot prolific box</p>

<p>Of bars I forged in Dragon Fire - I am what you're not</p>

<p>I will build this cage, put you inside and throw away the key</p>

<p>And there's no way that even Superman could save you - He'll need</p>

<p>Another way to bend The Stationary, harder than steel</p>

<p>Diamond cut bars I made to enslave you - so chill</p>

<p>Once I decided to compile my writings no one could deal</p>

<p>With what I might say next - Or have left to say still</p>

<p>My intervention of this system is designed to find all entrances</p>

<p>Disable any defense mechanisms and replace them with</p>

<p>Our own secure defensive turrets - So we're sure that this insurgence</p>

<p>Overwhelms the opposition - Forcing their cooperative</p>

<p>Surrender, retreat, white flags and unique</p>

<p>Cries for mercy - No one working for me even blinks</p>

<p>No one here will get to see another sunrise</p>

<p>We are killing every motherfucker and their mothers too - Fucker</p>

<p>6:44 PM</p>

<p>First things first - This entire fucking verse</p>

<p>Is like a murder weapon left in plain sight outside the church</p>

<p>And I reckon I could threaten everybody with this Hearse</p>

<p>I'm driving thru the crowded sections of my town in, it gets </p>

<p>If you question my methods - I'll infect you with a curse</p>

<p>That's too effective to correct - Nothing protects you when I </p>

<p>It's evident when I commit the crimes the devil won't permit</p>

<p>There's several other fucking levels of hell where he ain't been</p>

<p>Now get your men together - Line 'em up - So I can knock 'em </p>

<p>Apocalyptic Qaballistic wordsmithing that's too Profound</p>

<p>For you bitches to convince yourselves this Lyric isn't Bound</p>

<p>To bend reality around the beat - My Wizardry is now </p>

<p>worse</p>

<p>work</p>

<p>down</p>

<p>complete</p>

<p>complete</p>

<p>To bend reality around the beat - My Wizardry is now </p>

<p>Linguistical mystical script that's Cryptic and Mythic</p>

<p>Whenever shit like this is written all of Heaven's enlisted</p>

<p>In assisting with specific information - Like listen</p>

<p>Did you know if you're a patient of mine your new prescription</p>

<p>Is wordplay competitions with competent comprehensive</p>

<p>Fully formed complex interesting new Sentences</p>

<p>All this wicked verbiage that you've heard this bird come </p>

<p>deliver</p>

<p>thought</p>

<p>song</p>

<p>wrong</p>

<p>Isn't just silly worded nonsensical lyric filler</p>

<p>I can say what I mean - However I want</p>

<p>The language reconstructs itself around the things that I've </p>

<p>So whenever I endeavor to say clever shit - Watch</p>

<p>How fluidly this Druid Speech then proceeds to concoct</p>

<p>Amazingly understandable easy concepts that flow</p>

<p>Together like I've only been gifted with Prose</p>

<p>I'm Rhyming lines that don't belong and making them into a </p>

<p>How many times should I remind you I'm divine - Nothing's </p>

<p>The sound you hear is Krystal Klear</p>

<p>And since it's Krystal Klear</p>

<p>I'm gonna keep pounding this shit in your Ear</p>

<p>My murder weapons on the steps I left to make you second </p>

<p>guess</p>

<p>How belligerent I can get whenever someone tests</p>

<p>I can fix your curiosity - Come closer - I insist</p>

<p>The only interesting atrocities are ones that I commit</p>

<p>You think I'm bluffing - Won't do nothing</p>

<p>I'm just running my tongue but when</p>

<p>I'm confronted you suspect I'll play dumb or try something</p>

<p>To relieve the situation - But without any hesitation</p>

<p>I will take you out the Matrix, Neo - Death is only waiting
To awaken you to life - Don't worry, I might
Let you see another day - I'll let you live - Okay, I'm playing
Fuck around and find out what my Word is about
I'll take you out the fucking' picture
Then Immortalize in Scripture
Words that say - Here lies the Victim of a cataclysmic ending
He pretended he could weather the storm, but clearly didn't
Everybody take heed - I am who He
Underestimated - Does this say enough or do you need
Another lesson? Smith and Wesson M&amp;P 9 stressing
Do not test what you cannot correct - I'm tryna be effective
Through your vest and out your chest my R.I.P. rounds aren't 
impressed
But I warned you plenty times, so bye again I guess</p>

<p>The sound you hear is Krystal Klear
It's
And since it's Krystal Klear that's why  I'm pounding this shit 
in your Ear</p>

<p>I'm never gonna stop dropping this hot prolific box
Of bars I forged in Dragon Fire - I am what you're not
I will build this cage, put you inside and throw away the key
And there's no way that even Superman could save you - He'll 
need
Another way to bend The Stationary, harder than steel
Diamond cut bars I made to enslave you - so chill
Once I decided to compile my writings no one could deal
With what I might say next - Or have left to say still
My intervention of this system is designed to find all entrances
Disable any defense mechanisms and replace them with
Our own secure defensive turrets - So we're sure that this 
insurgence
Overwhelms the opposition - Forcing their cooperative
Surrender, retreat, white flags and unique
Cries for mercy - No one working for me even blinks
No one here will get to see another sunrise
We are killing every motherfucker and their mothers too -</p>

<p>2 - Down The Rabbit Hole</p>

<p>Sunday, June 30, 2024</p>

<p>11:15 PM</p>

<p>Let's go down the rabbit hole
Find all the rabbit shit
At the bottom</p>

<p>I go so motherfucking deep lyrically when I speak
No tongue in cheek I am uniquely equipped to kill the beat
With shit that no one ever says
They're too afraid they'll wind up dead
But I am eagerly awaiting the day these fucking feds
Try to take me out the picture cause the words I deliver
Connect dots no one in their club wants - So these Slytherin
Snakes in the grass can all kiss my ass
I'll pop your motherfucking top
You won't ever make me stop</p>

<p>My Smith &amp; Wesson has a lesson with no safety - If you're guessing
Every second I'll keep stressing you will fail to even test it
You might need to hear the hook first, before you take a look
So, let me spell it out - This book of rhymes tells every crook
I'm the only opponent composing potent provoking
Insurrectionary lyrics - So I won't be promoting
The Shit you know - I've awoken
To find the whole world is broken
With no soul - So this poet's mission is bold and you know it
I'm the only opponent composing potent provoking
Insurrectionary lyrics - So I won't be promoting
The Shit you know - I've awoken
To find the whole world is broken
With no soul - So this poet's mission is bold and you know it</p>

<p>Let me introduce myself once again - No help
Is coming to defend a single one of you - so as you melt
Beneath this heat I speak - Just to keep you weak
I want you all to drink it up as I erupt - Now think
What the fuck did you expect? That I'd just let
You evil motherfuckers run around and go unchecked</p>

<p>I am a threat so god damned serious you bitches can bet</p>

<p>I'll never let anyone hearing this ever forget</p>

<p>When I correct the whole planet, god damnit - I manage</p>

<p>To keep bandaging the broken hearted people I stand with</p>

<p>Command this evil to vanish - Brandish the sequel and damage</p>

<p>You when I speak - My Elites will delete your advantage</p>

<p>3 - Domestic Terrorist</p>

<p>Sunday, June 30, 2024</p>

<p>11:16 PM</p>

<p>Yeah, what you know about this
I'm a domestic terrorist
And it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers
Cause I brought this heater
Just to delete you bitch
What you know about this
I'm a domestic terrorist</p>

<p>I thought I told you motherfuckers not once but twice
No vest can protect this will go right
Through your chest if you test me, best think twice
I am what the Feds won't arrest because I might
Serenade the industry with terroristic imagery
Lyrics which your Therapist apparently is listening
To, but you aren't embarrassed when he mentions me
In front of your parents - I swear it holds merits
Even authority figures admit
It's legit as it gets when I'm spitting this shit
Pastors, cops, lawyers, inmates and
Women let their children hear my demands
That you all finally stop playing this game
Mental matrix, this shit's insane
Go to work then to Church - Stay inert and invert
Everything about life, and ignore the hurt
But I am here to make sure you all wake up
Break the gameboard, fuck every state - You cunts
Don't get it yet - Isn't this nation made of
Imaginary rules some Magisterial
Judge in a back room, buzzed with a sack full
Of money and drugs - Stealing what he can as you
Tax slaves play along with it as
If this bullshit should exist</p>

<p>But what you know about this - I'm a domestic terrorist
And it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers
Cause I brought this heater just to delete you bitch</p>

<p>Yeah, what you know about this - I'm a domestic terrorist</p>

<p>And it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers</p>

<p>Cause I brought this heater, just to delete you bitch</p>

<p>Arbitrary ordinance - Everyday there's more of it</p>

<p>Policy enforced by violent little boys when</p>

<p>Sovereign human beings stop being obedient</p>

<p>Trigger-happy Officers immediately extinguish them</p>

<p>Systematic servitude coming through to murder who</p>

<p>Ever doesn't listen to this Christianized worldview</p>

<p>Holy war, Heaven's more wicked and you're too</p>

<p>Weak to compete - Stay asleep and ignore truth</p>

<p>I am what you fuck nuts hate to embrace</p>

<p>Too late - Can't escape - I'll erupt in your face</p>

<p>Pompeii - No wait - This is Sodom and Gomorrah</p>

<p>Every whore of Babylon, I tried to warn you</p>

<p>You reap what you sow or didn't you know</p>

<p>That you get what you give and even though</p>

<p>You repent of your sins, no mercy grows</p>

<p>Just serpentine word cursing flows</p>

<p>From my lips and they hit every inch of your shit</p>

<p>Energy grid - Locked by Divine Writ</p>

<p>The Word made flesh - God-like when this</p>

<p>Lyrical spell that I bind you with takes hold</p>

<p>You'll do just what you're told</p>

<p>Cause my soul is ancient and much too old</p>

<p>For your children to pretend I will not bend</p>

<p>Old men till they break and then unfold them again</p>

<p>Cause what you know about this, I'm a domestic terrorist</p>

<p>And it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers</p>

<p>Cause I brought this heater, just to delete you bitch</p>

<p>What you know about this, I'm a domestic terrorist</p>

<p>And it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers</p>

<p>Cause I brought this heater, just to delete you bitch</p>

<p>You motherfuckers ready? Cause when I flip</p>

<p>This switch every soul here will insist</p>

<p>Get a grip, this is it - You hear this shit</p>

<p>Let me show you bitches - No defense</p>

<p>Holds so when words, my lips unleash</p>

<p>Completely delete every single weak</p>

<p>Motherfucker I discover, just know</p>

<p>One way or another I'll show</p>

<p>The whole damn world that at my command</p>

<p>Every fucking man, woman, child, and</p>

<p>Soul enlisted to resist will stand</p>

<p>Unified by what's whispered in</p>

<p>Each ear I near - Come witness real</p>

<p>Quick how it feels when lyrics like this</p>

<p>Hit your shit and convince you this legit</p>

<p>Poetic imprint shouldn't even exist</p>

<p>Skills leveled this high, kills devils with pride</p>

<p>I ain't even trying, what the fuck would you guys</p>

<p>Even do If I just suddenly decided to attack</p>

<p>And actually come back and fuck up each side</p>

<p>Northwest, southeast - There's nothing you can find</p>

<p>To protect your neck - What I'm stuffing in your mind</p>

<p>Will connect and resurrect souls summoned by Divine</p>

<p>Time codes etched in the stars remind</p>

<p>Us of the cosmic clock we forgot -</p>

<p>So my rhythmic syllable configurations</p>

<p>Take the blind and give them eyes to see</p>

<p>Beyond this matrix</p>

<p>So what you know about this, I'm a domestic terrorist</p>

<p>Yeah, and it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers</p>

<p>Cause I brought this heater, just to delete you bitch</p>

<p>Yeah, what you know about this</p>

<p>I'm a domestic terrorist</p>

<p>And it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers</p>

<p>Cause I brought this heater</p>

<p>Just to delete you bitch</p>

<p>What you know about this</p>

<p>I'm a domestic terrorist</p>

<p>I thought I told you motherfuckers not once but twice</p>

<p>No vest can protect this will go right</p>

<p>Through your chest if you test me, best think twice</p>

<p>I am what the Feds won't arrest because I might</p>

<p>Serenade the industry with terroristic imagery</p>

<p>Lyrics which your Therapist apparently is listening</p>

<p>To, but you aren't embarrassed when he mentions me</p>

<p>In front of your parents - I swear it holds merits</p>

<p>Even authority figures admit</p>

<p>It's legit as it gets when I'm spitting this shit</p>

<p>Pastors, cops, lawyers, inmates and</p>

<p>Women let their children hear my demands</p>

<p>That you all finally stop playing this game</p>

<p>Mental matrix, this shit's insane</p>

<p>Go to work then to Church - Stay inert and invert</p>

<p>Everything about life, and ignore the hurt</p>

<p>But I am here to make sure you all wake up</p>

<p>Break the gameboard, fuck every state - You cunts</p>

<p>Don't get it yet - Isn't this nation made of</p>

<p>Imaginary rules some Magisterial</p>

<p>Judge in a back room, buzzed with a sack full</p>

<p>Of money and drugs - Stealing what he can as you</p>

<p>Tax slaves play along with it as</p>

<p>If this bullshit should exist</p>

<p>But what you know about this - I'm a domestic terrorist</p>

<p>And it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers</p>

<p>Cause I brought this heater just to delete you bitch</p>

<p>Yeah, what you know about this - I'm a domestic terrorist</p>

<p>And it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers</p>

<p>Cause I brought this heater, just to delete you bitch</p>

<p>Arbitrary ordinance - Everyday there's more of it</p>

<p>Policy enforced by violent little boys when</p>

<p>Sovereign human beings stop being obedient</p>

<p>Trigger-happy Officers immediately extinguish them</p>

<p>Systematic servitude coming through to murder who</p>

<p>Ever doesn't listen to this Christianized worldview</p>

<p>Holy war, Heaven's more wicked and you're too</p>

<p>Weak to compete - Stay asleep and ignore truth</p>

<p>I am what you fuck nuts hate to embrace</p>

<p>Too late - Can't escape - I'll erupt in your face</p>

<p>Pompeii - No wait - This is Sodom and Gomorrah</p>

<p>Every whore of Babylon, I tried to warn you</p>

<p>You reap what you sow or didn't you know</p>

<p>That you get what you give and even though</p>

<p>You repent of your sins, no mercy grows</p>

<p>Just serpentine word cursing flows</p>

<p>From my lips and they hit every inch of your shit</p>

<p>Energy grid - Locked by Divine Writ</p>

<p>The Word made flesh - God-like when this</p>

<p>Lyrical spell that I bind you with takes hold</p>

<p>You'll do just what you're told</p>

<p>Cause my soul is ancient and much too old</p>

<p>For your children to pretend I will not bend</p>

<p>Old men till they break and then unfold them again</p>

<p>Cause what you know about this, I'm a domestic terrorist</p>

<p>And it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers</p>

<p>Cause I brought this heater, just to delete you bitch
What you know about this, I'm a domestic terrorist
And it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers
Cause I brought this heater, just to delete you bitch</p>

<p>You motherfuckers ready? Cause when I flip
This switch every soul here will insist
Get a grip, this is it - You hear this shit
Let me show you bitches - No defense
Holds so when words, my lips unleash
Completely delete every single weak
Motherfucker I discover, just know
One way or another I'll show
The whole damn world that at my command
Every fucking man, woman, child, and
Soul enlisted to resist will stand
Unified by what's whispered in
Each ear I near - Come witness real
Quick how it feels when lyrics like this
Hit your shit and convince you this legit
Poetic imprint shouldn't even exist
Skills leveled this high, kills devils with pride
I ain't even trying, what the fuck would you guys
Even do If I just suddenly decided to attack
And actually come back and fuck up each side
Northwest, southeast - There's nothing you can find
To protect your neck - What I'm stuffing in your mind
Will connect and resurrect souls summoned by Divine
Time codes etched in the stars remind
Us of the cosmic clock we forgot -
So my rhythmic syllable configurations
Take the blind and give them eyes to see
Beyond this matrix</p>

<p>So what you know about this, I'm a domestic terrorist
Yeah, and it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers
Cause I brought this heater, just to delete you bitch
Yeah, what you know about this, I'm a domestic terrorist
And it gets scary when I'm coming through your speakers

<p>4 - Relentless</p>

<p>Sunday, June 30, 2024</p>

<p>11:18 PM</p>

<p>Uh-huh, it's Hawk Eye, back again, just like I told you I'd be
I reincarnated to resist, and I do not give a shit
I reincarnated to resist, and I do not give a shit</p>

<p>Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day
You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game
Come up with something more constructive to discuss
I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become
I'm about to fucking invade
Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day
You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game
Come up with something more constructive to discuss
I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become
I'm about to fucking invade</p>

<p>With a persistent and relentless run on sentence
My lyrical intervention shifts the spiritual imprint of the system
The atmospheric conditions are fully cleared when this wisdom
Leaves my lips and you listen to the words you are hearing
Cause I'm a poet so potent, my one and only opponent
Composed a flow so cold, you know the words I spoke went and froze it
If they rewrote it to show me they could go toe to toe
I'd overload the voltage so it'd blow a hole through their soul
My destination is too great for anyone to debate
And I'm on my way to replace complacent tasteless mistakes
Create a basic data bank of who can stay and who can't
After I change the fucking game and rearrange everything
Cause when I step up to the mic and tell you cunts to play nice
I ain't joking, I have opened many minds with my light
My spoken hocus pocus focuses these words that I write
So that it provokes you hopeless vocalists too broken to fight
To come and find out how serious my rhymes get - You're delirious
I can amputate the complicated simply inferior, twisted methods you've molested
And correct the interior subtle purpose I have worked to insert between periods</p>

<p>Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day</p>

<p>You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game</p>

<p>Come up with something more constructive to discuss</p>

<p>I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become</p>

<p>I'm about to fucking invade</p>

<p>My sentence structure can rupture corrupted men</p>

<p>When this otherworldly pen I'm writing with begins erupting</p>

<p>Oh brothers, come and see if any who suffer my wrath</p>

<p>Pretend these are nothing but raps</p>

<p>After my attack, I bet you fuckers never come back</p>

<p>Combative obstinate obstacles - I imagined impossible</p>

<p>Dragons talking about how I have somehow managed to conquer you</p>

<p>With unstoppable force, I send immovable course</p>

<p>Corrections your direction, just a let you know second guessing</p>

<p>My methodology, which even God can't believe</p>

<p>Is reckless as thinking my weapons aren't effective - You need</p>

<p>Another lesson - Let me threaten to shoot through your protective vest</p>

<p>I bet these rounds still leave holes in your chest</p>

<p>A musical mercenary Heaven sent here to bury</p>

<p>Every unnecessary politician within this very</p>

<p>Broken system through persistent and consistent revisions</p>

<p>Of every sentence ever written by the government with its</p>

<p>Arbitrary library, filled with colorful laws</p>

<p>Retarded bullshit used to circumvent and fucking withdraw</p>

<p>All common sense from the equation - This is something that y'all</p>

<p>Anything but how wicked men are still opposed to their mission</p>

<p>Men like me who don't give a fuck, chose intervention</p>

<p>Militia troops in position uproot and then imprison</p>

<p>The guards first - Afterwards it's the Warden who'll listen</p>

<p>To the indictment I bring - It's such a frightening thing</p>

<p>Who would have thought, that all along, no one entered the ring</p>

<p>And called bullshit on the whole act - Evidently I'm back</p>

<p>To spit facts and impact every faction - These rats</p>

<p>Must have forgotten, I'm rotten - Bin Laden optical promptings</p>

<p>Come up with something more constructive to discuss</p>

<p>I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become</p>

<p>I'm about to fucking invade</p>

<p>I'm about to fucking invade</p>

<p>Uh-huh, it's Hawk Eye, back again, just like I told you I'd be</p>

<p>I reincarnated to resist, and I do not give a shit</p>

<p>I reincarnated to resist, and I do not give a shit</p>

<p>Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day</p>

<p>You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game</p>

<p>Come up with something more constructive to discuss</p>

<p>I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become</p>

<p>I'm about to fucking invade</p>

<p>With a persistent and relentless run on sentence</p>

<p>My lyrical intervention shifts the spiritual imprint of the system</p>

<p>The atmospheric conditions are fully cleared when this wisdom</p>

<p>Leaves my lips and you listen to the words you are hearing</p>

<p>Cause I'm a poet so potent, my one and only opponent</p>

<p>Composed a flow so cold, you know the words I spoke went and froze it</p>

<p>If they rewrote it to show me they could go toe to toe</p>

<p>I'd overload the voltage so it'd blow a hole through their soul</p>

<p>My destination is too great for anyone to debate</p>

<p>And I'm on my way to replace complacent tasteless mistakes</p>

<p>Create a basic data bank of who can stay and who can't</p>

<p>After I change the fucking game and rearrange everything</p>

<p>Cause when I step up to the mic and tell you cunts to play nice</p>

<p>I ain't joking, I have opened many minds with my light</p>

<p>My spoken hocus pocus focuses these words that I write
So that it provokes you hopeless vocalists too broken to fight
To come and find out how serious my rhymes get - You're delirious
I can amputate the complicated simply inferior, twisted methods you've molested
And correct the interior subtle purpose I have worked to insert between periods</p>

<p>Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day
You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game
Come up with something more constructive to discuss
I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become
I'm about to fucking invade
Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day
You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game
Come up with something more constructive to discuss
I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become
I'm about to fucking invade</p>

<p>My sentence structure can rupture corrupted men
When this otherworldly pen I'm writing with begins erupting
Oh brothers, come and see if any who suffer my wrath
Pretend these are nothing but raps
After my attack, I bet you fuckers never come back
Combative obstinate obstacles - I imagined impossible
Dragons talking about how I have somehow managed to conquer you
With unstoppable force, I send immovable course
Corrections your direction, just a let you know second guessing
My methodology, which even God can't believe
Is reckless as thinking my weapons aren't effective - You need
Another lesson - Let me threaten to shoot through your protective vest
I bet these rounds still leave holes in your chest
A musical mercenary Heaven sent here to bury
Every unnecessary politician within this very
Broken system through persistent and consistent revisions
Of every sentence ever written by the government with its
Arbitrary library, filled with colorful laws
Retarded bullshit used to circumvent and fucking withdraw
All common sense from the equation - This is something that y'all
Can't even see - How about I say it right in front on the lawn</p>

<p>Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day
You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game
Come up with something more constructive to discuss
I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become

<p>Fuck the White House politicking piece of shit men and women</p>

<p>Who keep pretending this bitch ass system we live in</p>

<p>Is all we've got - What's permitted is full submission</p>

<p>Religious states sanctioned worship of tax dollars we give 'em</p>

<p>Virtual signal competitions - Lying ambitious Christians</p>

<p>Convince the citizens enslaved by this persistent and vicious</p>

<p>Hypnotic scriptwriter's venomous penmanship, to quit bitching</p>

<p>And let Representative Senate Members forget to mention</p>

<p>Anything but how wicked men are still opposed to their mission</p>

<p>Men like me who don't give a fuck, chose intervention</p>

<p>Militia troops in position uproot and then imprison</p>

<p>The guards first - Afterwards it's the Warden who'll listen</p>

<p>To the indictment I bring - It's such a frightening thing</p>

<p>Who would have thought, that all along, no one entered the ring</p>

<p>And called bullshit on the whole act - Evidently I'm back</p>

<p>To spit facts and impact every faction - These rats</p>

<p>Must have forgotten, I'm rotten - Bin Laden optical promptings</p>

<p>Keep 9/11 Building Seven witnesses from unboxing</p>

<p>Massive unstoppable conscious legions of Network Department teams</p>

<p>We've infiltrated to bring the truth to your TV screens</p>

<p>I'd overload the voltage so it'd blow a hole through their soul</p>

<p>My destination is too great for anyone to debate</p>

<p>And I'm on my way to replace complacent tasteless mistakes</p>

<p>Create a basic data bank of who can stay and who can't</p>

<p>After I change the fucking game and rearrange everything</p>

<p>Cause when I step up to the mic and tell you cunts to play nice</p>

<p>I ain't joking, I have opened many minds with my light</p>

<p>My spoken hocus pocus focuses these words that I write</p>

<p>So that it provokes you hopeless vocalists too broken to fight</p>

<p>To come and find out how serious my rhymes get - You're delirious</p>

<p>I can amputate the complicated simply inferior, twisted methods you've molested</p>

<p>And correct the interior subtle purpose I have worked to insert between periods</p>

<p>Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day</p>

<p>You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game</p>

<p>Oh brothers, come and see if any who suffer my wrath</p>

<p>Pretend these are nothing but raps</p>

<p>After my attack, I bet you fuckers never come back</p>

<p>Combative obstinate obstacles - I imagined impossible</p>

<p>Dragons talking about how I have somehow managed to conquer you</p>

<p>With unstoppable force, I send immovable course</p>

<p>Corrections your direction, just a let you know second guessing</p>

<p>My methodology, which even God can't believe</p>

<p>Is reckless as thinking my weapons aren't effective - You need</p>

<p>Another lesson - Let me threaten to shoot through your protective vest</p>

<p>I bet these rounds still leave holes in your chest</p>

<p>A musical mercenary Heaven sent here to bury</p>

<p>Every unnecessary politician within this very</p>

<p>Broken system through persistent and consistent revisions</p>

<p>Of every sentence ever written by the government with its</p>

<p>Arbitrary library, filled with colorful laws</p>

<p>Retarded bullshit used to circumvent and fucking withdraw</p>

<p>All common sense from the equation - This is something that y'all</p>

<h1>5 - Never Heard Of Me</h1>

<p>5 - Never Heard Of Me?</p>

<p>Sunday, June 30, 2024</p>

<p>11:18 PM</p>

<p>Yeah
For those of you unfamiliar, let me introduce myself
My name is Hawk Eye
And it ain't got shit to do with no comic book characters</p>

<p>I know you never heard of me, but bitch you are listening
To the wordsmith bird, who's lyrical witchery
Captivates your attention
I am the great intervention
You never saw this shit coming
But my statements are blistering
I'm invading the industry to create a new energy grid
And basically, I'm saying - I ain't playing, this is the end
Of mumble rap - I'm bringing back bundles of verbal attacks
Underhanded methods to subtly murder tracks
Witness how this hypnotist is wickedly gifted
With an ensemble of twisted words within his sentences
Its uncommon for a song or any written inscription
As intricate as I'm spitting to exist</p>

<p>Let me reintroduce you to my speaker abuse
I'm a god damn man too evil for Zeus
Thor, Hercules, and Odin, Horus, Isis, Anubis
Or Athena to extinguish rhyme schemes when I set them loose
Fire flowing like lava from my soul can revive
A dead world too cold, which no one can thrive in
I'm not going on surviving just to suffer and die
When I can be the change we need to see
A poet you vibe with</p>

<p>You've never heard of me, (Hi) but bitch you are listening
You've never heard of me, but bitch you are listening
To the wordsmith bird, who's lyrical witchery
Hi! - I know you've never heard of me, but bitch you are listening
To the oh - Wait - Yeah</p>

<p>I know you never heard me, but bitch you are listening</p>

<p>To the word smith bird, who's lyrical witchery</p>

<p>Hi, I know you've never heard of me, but bitch you are listening</p>

<p>To Hawk Eye - The wordsmith bird, who's lyrical witchery</p>

<p>Came to invoke religiously omnipotent wizardry</p>

<p>Through incantations spoken with intentional focus</p>

<p>This Hocus Pocus is so potent every poet you know</p>

<p>Is almost a joke when compared with how my word play keeps stoking</p>

<p>The fire inside your heart - My divinely inspired art</p>

<p>Comes from higher levels - I am the vessel here to impart</p>

<p>Linguistic mystical, rhythmic, prolific scripture intended</p>

<p>To make a dent in this wicked mind-controlling system's defense</p>

<p>As you listen, bear witness to this druidic hit list</p>

<p>Black magicians, politicians, and voodoo apprentices</p>

<p>Dark witches and morticians who assist them in rituals</p>

<p>And you spiritual officials molesting little kids - You're through</p>

<p>My tongue casts spells to lock you in hell</p>

<p>I'm binding demons when I'm singing - Couldn't you tell</p>

<p>You must be out your fucking mind or something</p>

<p>I'm not bluffing - My rhymes summon divine destruction</p>

<p>Holy retribution - Execution - Every method I am using</p>

<p>To remind you why I'm here again only seems to confuse you</p>

<p>So let me explain this shit again - I reincarnated just to resist</p>

<p>And Hi! - I know you never heard of me</p>

<p>I'm Hawk Eye</p>

<p>But bitch, you are listening to the wordsmith bird</p>

<p>With lyrical witchery</p>

<p>And I know you never heard of me</p>

<p>But Hi! - I'm Hawk Eye</p>

<p>And bitch, you are listening to the wordsmith bird</p>

<p>6 - Spiteful Poetry</p>

<p>Sunday, June 30, 2024</p>

<p>11:21 PM</p>

<p>Coincidentally, I'm simply the archenemy of any
Motherfucker too corrupted by the system - Now just listen
My intentional offensive wordplay is condescending
It's unrelenting when I'm sending incendiary transmissions</p>

<p>Don't you bitches get it yet, or do you need another threat
I will position my technicians right in your kitchen - Let me check
Which politician should I mention? If you didn't hear me yet
It's my mission to resist - Here's my official evidence</p>

<p>I'm murdering microphones as I compose a spiteful poem - My opponents
Know I'm not the one to be fucked with - I have the right components
I am what you're stuck with now - And this cypher's hyper-focused
Sniper's loaded - Viper Bolt end life before your eyes, it won't</p>

<p>Miss - I must insist, you bitches, really see the picture
This Epistle on my lips is like a missile - It's off the Richter
And the Scripture I submit intervenes - That's why I spit this
Holy Fire - Burning liars - My empire's too legit</p>

<p>For your schemes and propaganda to command a damn thing
And my whole team's a rebel band of Jedi Samurai who bring
Retribution to you mutant, anti-human foreign nuisance
Artificial motherfuckers - My adjustment bureau doesn't</p>

<p>Fuck around - They do their job, expert work like ancient gods
Resurrected to correct a damn infection - It's so odd
That you'd forget about this shit - Cause Westside is what you'll get
Every time - Let me remind you, this is a war that you can't win</p>

<p>And I'm certainly far beyond your comprehension
Bars I spawned and then suspended
Right above your head mention, my position
Is within reach</p>

<p>But if you bitches try to lift this weight I placed</p>

<p>I hope you take some time to reassess the situation you face</p>

<p>Cause I'll break each fucking one of you - Greatness is what's coming through</p>

<p>I'll wake my legion just to do what I already said - My Crew</p>

<p>Is like a sleeping giant - Too defiant to be stopped - So when we riot, non-compliance</p>

<p>Isn't an option - You rotten fucks need a coffin? Carpenter Jesus has got them</p>

<p>Best believe me, we're watching - yeah</p>

<p>And I'm dismantling everything - You can't cancel or bury me</p>

<p>I'm the very first person you can't hurt - It get's worse</p>

<p>My murderous lyrics are more than words - You can feel it</p>

<p>In your spirit - That's why I am here to make sure you fear it</p>

<p>Your reign of terror has ended - Bear witness to this druidic</p>

<p>Apocalypse I came equipped to fucking share with you idiots</p>

<p>Do you need another line, or is this enough rhymed</p>

<p>Conversation? I am patiently waiting for your reply</p>

<p>My whole statement here is basically just me creating ways to keep</p>

<p>Bending words around the beat - Offending slurs wounds wound so neatly</p>

<p>But don't you see how effortlessly I'm communicating</p>

<p>Every fucking sentence in this track is just me demonstrating</p>

<p>It's uncommon for anyone to speak so clear</p>

<p>And say what they mean without dissembling and never veer</p>

<p>Off course - Away from subject - Sidebar the discussion</p>

<p>When I speak you know I meant for you to hear me - So fuck it</p>

<p>I'm done pretending to give a shit - You can all go to hell</p>

<p>Reptilian puppets and Illuminati fuckwits - Oh well</p>

<p>My intentional offensive wordplay is condescending</p>

<p>It's unrelenting when I'm sending incendiary transmissions</p>

<p>Don't you bitches get it yet, or do you need another threat</p>

<p>I will position my technicians right in your kitchen - Let me check</p>

<p>Which politician should I mention? If you didn't hear me yet</p>

<p>It's my mission to resist - Here's my official evidence</p>

<p>I'm murdering microphones as I compose a spiteful poem - My opponents</p>

<p>Know I'm not the one to be fucked with - I have the right components</p>

<p>I am what you're stuck with now - And this cypher's hyper-focused</p>

<p>Sniper's loaded - Viper Bolt end life before your eyes, it won't</p>

<p>Miss - I must insist, you bitches, really see the picture</p>

<p>This Epistle on my lips is like a missile - It's off the Richter</p>

<p>And the Scripture I submit intervenes - That's why I spit this</p>

<p>Holy Fire - Burning liars - My empire's too legit</p>

<p>For your schemes and propaganda to command a damn thing</p>

<p>And my whole team's a rebel band of Jedi Samurai who bring</p>

<p>Retribution to you mutant, anti-human foreign nuisance</p>

<p>Artificial motherfuckers - My adjustment bureau doesn't</p>

<p>Fuck around - They do their job, expert work like ancient gods</p>

<p>Resurrected to correct a damn infection - It's so odd</p>

<p>That you'd forget about this shit - Cause Westside is what you'll get</p>

<p>Every time - Let me remind you, this is a war that you can't win</p>

<p>And I'm certainly far beyond your comprehension</p>

<p>Bars I spawned and then suspended</p>

<p>Right above your head mention, my position</p>

<p>Is within reach</p>

<p>But if you bitches try to lift this weight I placed</p>

<p>I hope you take some time to reassess the situation you face</p>

<p>Cause I'll break each fucking one of you - Greatness is what's coming through</p>

<p>I'll wake my legion just to do what I already said - My Crew</p>

<p>Is like a sleeping giant - Too defiant to be stopped - So when we riot, non-compliance</p>

<p>Isn't an option - You rotten fucks need a coffin? Carpenter Jesus has got them</p>

<p>Best believe me, we're watching - yeah</p>

<p>And I'm dismantling everything - You can't cancel or bury me</p>

<p>I'm the very first person you can't hurt - It get's worse</p>

<p>My murderous lyrics are more than words - You can feel it</p>

<p>In your spirit - That's why I am here to make sure you fear it</p>

<p>Your reign of terror has ended - Bear witness to this druidic</p>

<p>Apocalypse I came equipped to fucking share with you idiots</p>

<p>Do you need another line, or is this enough rhymed</p>

<p>Conversation? I am patiently waiting for your reply</p>

<p>My whole statement here is basically just me creating ways to keep</p>

<p>Bending words around the beat - Offending slurs wounds wound so neatly</p>

<p>But don't you see how effortlessly I'm communicating</p>

<p>Every fucking sentence in this track is just me demonstrating</p>

<p>It's uncommon for anyone to speak so clear</p>

<p>And say what they mean without dissembling and never veer</p>

<p>Off course - Away from subject - Sidebar the discussion</p>

<p>When I speak you know I meant for you to hear me - So fuck it</p>

<p>I'm done pretending to give a shit - You can all go to hell</p>

<p>Reptilian puppets and Illuminati fuckwits - Oh well</p>

<p>The Devil's in the details
The Devil's in the details
The Devil's in the details
Here, let me sever the connection altogether
Because the Devil is in the details</p>

<p>I never let this shit get to me  - So fuck the Propaganda
I don't give a damn about your plan - I can handle
Your cleverly twisted schemes - Understand just who I am
Before you bitches get restricted - See
I came to wake my Legion - If you need another reason
Hunting Demons is my Passion - I ain't asking
I'm deleting every last one I see
So do you really wanna keep fucking around
Cause you are bound to be
Another motherfucker who's found six feet deep
Underground - I won't allow Bullshit to Speak
Very Loud for too long - So sit down - I'm appalled
And I am called to humble Proud motherfuckers - Get the Saw
Cut the shit - I'm too belligerent to ever let you Bitches get
Confused, here's the rules - I ain't letting you win shit
Because the Devil is in the Details</p>

<p>So take your best shot - Oh I forgot to mention
I'm in position now bitch and my Trigger Finger's itching
So call the Mortician and the Cops
Because my murderous intervention can't be stopped
I'm here to make sure you listen - Observe - Pay attention
The discerner of wisdom always drops
Jewels for you Fools - Shit hidden from your view
Right there in front of you - Point Blank - You never knew
These cryptic hieroglyphic archetypal inscriptions
Were symbolic universal languages written
Specifically to trick your mind - Subconscious hypnotism
Sigils Witches use to get you to forget your intuition</p>

<p>The Devil's in the details</p>

<p>Here, let me sever the connection altogether - It's my pleasure</p>

<p>I am what you bitches fear</p>

<p>Second guess it all you want - Just know my Rhymes still threaten</p>

<p>Every section of hell, and yeah I'm wishing 'em well</p>

<p>But when I get to spitting fire all you Liars will melt</p>

<p>I'm required to entirely obliterate fools</p>

<p>Who conspire to defy my Dictates and you</p>

<p>Motherfuckers might of thought this wasn't serious but</p>

<p>Guess what - I'll twist these words till you're delirious from</p>

<p>Tryna wrap your mind around the shit I'm pounding in your head</p>

<p>Till you give up and finally fucking hear what I said</p>

<p>With just words I'll conjure up the perfect storm for you</p>

<p>Subtle changes rearranging every angle to</p>

<p>Mention that my Magick ripped the fabric back then</p>

<p>In 2019</p>

<p>Epstein Voodoo</p>

<p>You're too late to stop me 2020 came and I dropped</p>

<p>Full Disclosure right before Covid Craziness locked</p>

<p>Down the whole fucking planet, god damn it - Why not</p>

<p>Distract us with more scare tactics - but Ghislaine got popped</p>

<p>Now I know you bitches hear me - Loud and Clear</p>

<p>My guerrillas in the trenches have surrounded you queers</p>

<p>No quarter - My orders say Exterminate</p>

<p>So I hate to inform you but there is no more debate</p>

<p>You can see the net closing in tightly but when</p>

<p>I spring this fucking trap that you're already in</p>

<p>Then you'll really get the picture of my problematic scripture</p>

<h2>8 - The Game</h2>

<p>8 - The Game</p>

<p>Sunday, June 30, 2024</p>

<p>11:08 PM</p>

<p>Yo, since you bitches wanna play
Let me just fucking say
You're not equipped for all this shit that I am pushing in your brain
And I warned you that one day
You'd push me to the edge
And then I'd motherfucking snap
So Listen close cause what I said
Was Since you bitches wanna play
Well just let me fucking say</p>

<p>Look - you're playing checkers with your life
And this lecture that I write
Is a gesture I expect you to respect or I might
Teach you a lesson - Any questions I confess this rhyme session
Is a weaponized method my specialized epic
Lyrical threats wreck into every section with
I'm here to bury my sentences into wary apprentices
Kill each witness with wicked poetic spells so specific
That no one can tell when listening, but there's various instances
Of hypnotic deposits slipped to you through this tonic
It's ironic moronic neurotic fools spewing vomit
Are the ones my harmonic truthful supersonic
Cosmic phonic mnemonic composite offering wanted
To infect and subject to whatever comes next
A mind opened by spoken hocus pocus won't get
To close it or let what's awoken die yet
So I hope you guys focus on the Soul Inside - Let's
Get back to business - If you bitches really wanna die, listen
I can hit you with this divine wisdom
The biblical epistles I've penciled paint the picture
My Holy Scripture is so legit - What I've written
No official even tries to contradict, I spit that shit no one prevents

<p>Wicked System would listen if those opposed start resisting</p>

<p>The venomous hypocritical silence tyrants insisted</p>

<p>You're not equipped for all this shit that I am pushing in your brain</p>

<p>Since you bitches wanna play</p>

<p>Let me just fucking say</p>

<p>And I warned you that one day</p>

<p>You'd push me to the edge</p>

<p>And then I'd motherfucking snap</p>

<p>So listen close cause what I said</p>

<p>Was since you bitches wanna play</p>

<p>You'll wind up dead</p>

<p>9 - The Shadow Is Rising</p>

<p>Sunday, June 30, 2024</p>

<p>10:56 PM</p>

<p>Yeah - The shadow is rising
Does anybody know a rapper?
Someone who writes raps?</p>

<p>My influential instrumental artistry is beneficial
It's official - I am with you like a subatomic missile
I Aim this pencil - This shit hits who ever gets in it's way
If you artificial motherfuckers
Want a War here's what you'll suffer
Every undercover brother
Will discover there's no buffer
When my tongue delivers another word
No puns intended but something you're
Forgetting is I am beginning
This unrelenting and absurd
Lyrical poetic flow so you'll know
When I speak slow - You should listen
Quit your bitching before I call the Mortician
Coroner and fucking cops to come get you
When I pop off a few shots and watch you drop
My aim is true and you do Not
Get the picture I intend
To paint for you within this scripture
But penmanship like this
Can quickly shift and rearrange the mixture
Speed the pace up just a bit
What amazing wicked shit
Can I say to make you take a break
From hating what's Legit
Oh I know
I'll sing this song for you
I think it goes like this</p>

<p>Authentic original - Symbolic rituals
Words that I spit are like cryptic and mystical
Sigils I've written all over - Invading your Soul</p>

<p>I told you, this witchcraft is biblical</p>

<p>Spiritual Indigo here to kill Wendigo</p>

<p>My Holy Fire entirely filtered through</p>

<p>Lyrical Rhythmic Descriptive Specific</p>

<p>Empirical Sentences - Bitch you are Listening</p>

<p>To the Wordsmith Bird - Or haven't you heard</p>

<p>I've returned with my whole tribe</p>

<p>Burning down old Lies</p>

<p>And no I don't give a fuck if you hoes try</p>

<p>To stop me - I'll kill your whole posse</p>

<p>I'm not what you pussy's thought</p>

<p>Bring you an Army, the Navy and maybe</p>

<p>A veteran line up of better men</p>

<p>Than what you bitches provided - It's evident</p>

<p>Heaven sent me to make war</p>

<p>Against all you terrorists</p>

<p>I am what you're</p>

<p>Unprepared to deal with</p>

<p>Murderous lyrics leave my lips and sure</p>

<p>I can rap faster or slow this shit down</p>

<p>It's not like it matters - I told you clowns</p>

<p>This isn't a circus - I'm here to kill serpents</p>

<p>Throw 'em in the furnace - You're learning this now</p>

<p>I am the Lion of Judah</p>

<p>More Christ-like than Buddha</p>

<p>My holy empire is rising - Anubis</p>

<p>To all of you fools who've been trying to rule</p>

<p>This is my world, you little girls</p>

<p>Better play nice or with this Sword</p>

<p>Of Truth in mouth, I'll convince the Lord</p>

<p>Of Hosts to invoke omnipotent Hocus Pocus</p>

<p>You think it's a joke</p>

<p>I am the ender of wars across stars</p>

<p>Galactic Commander of Heavenly Hordes</p>

<p>Sun Tzu - Do you ever regret</p>

<p>Never letting your enemies up off the floor</p>

<p>Me neither - Kill 'em again and then leave a</p>

<p>Monument for men to believe in</p>

<p>Something impossible happened</p>

<p>The whole damn battalion</p>

<p>Got murdered by him this evening</p>

<p>Reminding you fuck niggas not to play games</p>

<p>With your life - The world is a stage</p>

<p>But I'm writing the script</p>

<p>Don't make me invent</p>

<p>New ways to say</p>

<p>I don't give a shit</p>

<p>If you ever again take a breath or get rest</p>

<p>Fuck your entire pathetic existence</p>

<p>I'm letting you know right now, as clear as I can</p>

<p>You don't want me to show my hand</p>

<p>Because the Devil and several others</p>

<p>All running for cover when they see me coming</p>

<p>Should tell you something</p>

<p>I'll rip down the Kingdom</p>

<p>Annoy the shit outta God while I'm at it</p>

<p>And if he attacks His end will be tragic</p>

<p>Apocalyse Now - Roll back the clouds</p>

<p>Unveiling the mystery of what sounds</p>

<p>Like Higher Divine - Sacred Aligned</p>

<p>Cosmic Unfoldment of Holy Design</p>

<p>I am the Craftsman, the Poet, the Rhyme</p>

<p>Said I'd be back and now I am - So Hi</p>

<p>Reincarnated to resist</p>

<p>You motherfuckers won't believe this</p>

<p>But long ago I told you no</p>

<p>One ever can extinguish</p>

<p>Our Vibe - So why have I returned</p>

<p>Soul Tribe knows My entire Verse</p>

<p>Of Violent Rhymes reverse the Curse</p>

<p>Spells Bind these Tyrants - I invert</p>

<p>The whole game that they play</p>

<p>And I make 'em say</p>

<p>If it weren't for me</p>

<p>Then they'd be okay</p>

<p>But I am here now, and you best fuckin' fear it</p>

<p>These lyrics are Spiritually Resonant</p>

<p>And I know that you Hear it</p>

<p>I am what you all want to kill</p>

<p>But Karma is real - So just know I will</p>

<p>Keep popping up and leaving it all fucked</p>

<p>I'm deleting the mainframe that are plugged directly into</p>

<p>You're hesitant to look in the mirror and see who</p>

<p>You really are - But I see your Soul</p>

<p>I got a Hawk's Eye view bitch didn't you know</p>

<p>Nothing can hide - Everything's clear</p>

<p>Darkness retreats when light reveals</p>

<p>What lies beneath the surface</p>

<p>Reminding me to work with energies I find</p>

<p>Deep inside Blinded Men</p>

<p>That's why I speak my rhyme</p>

<p>Awaken the dead -Lazarus yeah</p>

<p>Get your ass up</p>

<p>You heard what I said</p>

<p>More evil than them came to seek and destroy every demon</p>
