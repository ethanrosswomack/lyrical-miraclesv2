Let's go down the rabbit hole
Find all the rabbit shit
At the bottom

I go so motherfucking deep lyrically when I speak
No tongue in cheek I am uniquely equipped to kill the beat
With shit that no one ever says
They're too afraid they'll wind up dead
But I am eagerly awaiting the day these fucking feds
Try to take me out the picture cause the words I deliver
Connect dots no one in their club wants - So these Slytherin
Snakes in the grass can all kiss my ass
I'll pop your motherfucking top
You won't ever make me stop

My Smith & Wesson has a lesson with no safety - If you're guessing
Every second I'll keep stressing you will fail to even test it
You might need to hear the hook first, before you take a look
So, let me spell it out - This book of rhymes tells every crook
I'm the only opponent composing potent provoking
Insurrectionary lyrics - So I won't be promoting
The Shit you know - I've awoken
To find the whole world is broken
With no soul - So this poet's mission is bold and you know it
I'm the only opponent composing potent provoking
Insurrectionary lyrics - So I won't be promoting
The Shit you know - I've awoken
To find the whole world is broken
With no soul - So this poet's mission is bold and you know it

Let me introduce myself once again - No help
Is coming to defend a single one of you - so as you melt
Beneath this heat I speak - Just to keep you weak
I want you all to drink it up as I erupt - Now think
What the fuck did you expect? That I'd just let
You evil motherfuckers run around and go unchecked

I am a threat so god damned serious you bitches can bet

I'll never let anyone hearing this ever forget

When I correct the whole planet, god damnit - I manage

To keep bandaging the broken hearted people I stand with

Command this evil to vanish - Brandish the sequel and damage

You when I speak - My Elites will delete your advantage

My Smith & Wesson has a lesson with no safety - If you're guessing

Every second I'll keep stressing you will fail to even test it

You might need to hear the hook first, before you take a look

So, let me spell it out - This book of rhymes tells every crook

I'm the only opponent composing potent provoking

Insurrectionary lyrics - So I won't be promoting

The Shit you know - I've awoken

To find the whole world is broken

With no soul - So this poet's mission is bold and you know it

I'm the only opponent composing potent provoking

Insurrectionary lyrics - So I won't be promoting

The Shit you know - I've awoken

To find the whole world is broken

With no soul - So this poet's mission is bold and you know it

Yeah, I did it

I found all the rabbit shit

Here, ya'll want some

Get the fuck out of my face
