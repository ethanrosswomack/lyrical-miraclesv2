This is psychological warfare, so deep
They kill any motherfucker who dares to speak
But I'm not like the others that you shot, cause I keep
Fuckin' telling you freaks, you can't stop me, see
This is psychological warfare, so deep
They kill any motherfucker who dares to speak
But I'm not like the others that you shot, cause I keep
Fuckin' telling you freaks, you can't stop me, see

Look - This is where you run for cover - I repeat
Retreat while you still can - I am dying to leak
Information to these patients who keep trying to sleep
I'll wake the whole nation - I don't mind - Complete
Destruction - I ain't bluffing - You will find out fucking
Around with me how what sounds like nothing
But pounding beats summons a thousand of each one
More pissed off than the first, and now they keep coming
Online - My rhyme scheme is designed
To breakdown mind control - You never know how I
Might affect the public - Give 'em just what they won't find
Anywhere else but within my lines
So fuck the Russians, no discussion - Bitch I'm what's coming
And a war with me you're gonna see is such a conundrum
My thunder wasn't what you dumb sluts believed - It's something
More abrupt that you're confronted with - You whores keep wondering
If my words are just poetic similes - How pathetic
You fuckers need to hear the beat first? Here let me get it
I'm what you edit out the fucking reddit feeds, don't you let it
Get off the leash - Contain this beast, before it starts spreading
Because my lyrics are mystical, cryptic, eerie descriptions
Used to benefit specific individual spirits
These coded languages are dangerous and any who hear it
Instantly convert to atheist conspiracy theorists
Thoroughly convinced that violence is the only way to
Break through the bullshit pretense - Who knew
That lyrical assassinations I've created for you

Would incite the population to invade every room

Murdering politicians - Yeah, legislate this shit bitch

Insurrection isn't what you saw on January 6th

Seasoned veterans holding weapons kill off everyone elected

To protect our rights - I guess its worth the fight - Its not a threat

This is psychological warfare, so deep

They kill any motherfucker who dares to speak

But I'm not like the others that you shot, cause I keep

Fuckin' telling you freaks, you can't stop me, see

This is psychological warfare, so deep

They kill any motherfucker who dares to speak

But I'm not like the others that you shot, cause I keep

Fuckin' telling you freaks, you can't stop me, see

They better

Shadow Ban me

I'm the shadow banned rapper back to fracture the scene

And fucking crack the foundations these Masons believed

Would hold forever - I will sever every god damned string

Attached to you fuckin puppets - Now you're stuck with me

And you can't silence or quiet this fucking riot

These violent men and women that I've incited

Won't comply with you tyrants

No they don't buy it - That's why I am still trying to be

Loud enough to keep you dumb cunts quiet, you see

Cause when I came to invade

And make you bitches behave

I wasn't asking for permission

Okay listen - A slave

Is someone you control with whips

And hit with shit just to get

Their brothers to submit

But hypnotists witness this

I enlisted to persist - so fuck with me and you'll wish

That my relentless intervention didn't even exist

Cause I'm here to lead the resistance

And make you bleed -  Murder business

Is what you see within these trenches

But if you need my assistance

I will keep popping up everywhere

You can't stop me and never will

It's impossible - Apocalyptic gospels with very clear

Messages are heard regardless of any attempt

To prevent the lyrics sent from Heaven through these lips

From being slipped in the script then broadcasted legitimately

I'll get the whole fucking network to quit

Cause my assault on this system is an awful addition

When my tongue becomes the gun that's going off in this prison

It gets all the attention - That's what you call wicked wisdom

Intended military confrontation solved with precision

You lost the war at the start - I came to tear you apart

You think you're more than capable of taking me, but you aren't

This is psychological warfare, so deep

They kill any motherfucker who dares to speak

But I'm not like the others that you shot, cause I keep

Fuckin' telling you freaks, you can't stop me, see

This is psychological warfare, so deep

They kill any motherfucker who dares to speak

But I'm not like the others that you shot, cause I keep
