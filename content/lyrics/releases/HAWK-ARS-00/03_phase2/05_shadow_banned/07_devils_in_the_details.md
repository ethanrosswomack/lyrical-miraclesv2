The Devil's in the details
The Devil's in the details
The Devil's in the details
Here, let me sever the connection altogether
Because the Devil is in the details

I never let this shit get to me  - So fuck the Propaganda
I don't give a damn about your plan - I can handle
Your cleverly twisted schemes - Understand just who I am
Before you bitches get restricted - See
I came to wake my Legion - If you need another reason
Hunting Demons is my Passion - I ain't asking
I'm deleting every last one I see
So do you really wanna keep fucking around
Cause you are bound to be
Another motherfucker who's found six feet deep
Underground - I won't allow Bullshit to Speak
Very Loud for too long - So sit down - I'm appalled
And I am called to humble Proud motherfuckers - Get the Saw
Cut the shit - I'm too belligerent to ever let you Bitches get
Confused, here's the rules - I ain't letting you win shit
Because the Devil is in the Details

So take your best shot - Oh I forgot to mention
I'm in position now bitch and my Trigger Finger's itching
So call the Mortician and the Cops
Because my murderous intervention can't be stopped
I'm here to make sure you listen - Observe - Pay attention
The discerner of wisdom always drops
Jewels for you Fools - Shit hidden from your view
Right there in front of you - Point Blank - You never knew
These cryptic hieroglyphic archetypal inscriptions
Were symbolic universal languages written
Specifically to trick your mind - Subconscious hypnotism
Sigils Witches use to get you to forget your intuition

The Devil's in the details

Here, let me sever the connection altogether - It's my pleasure

I am what you bitches fear

Divine Intervention when my Rhymes hit your ear

The Devil's in the details

Here, let me sever the connection altogether - It's my pleasure

To interfere

Listen here

To interfere

Listen here

I am what you bitches fear

Divine Intervention when my Rhymes hit your ear

I'm a Lethal weapon stepping down from heaven

7 Spiritual Officials left the Throne they were protecting

Just to hear my Lyrical insurrection

Second guess it all you want - Just know my Rhymes still threaten

Every section of hell, and yeah I'm wishing 'em well

But when I get to spitting fire all you Liars will melt

I'm required to entirely obliterate fools

Who conspire to defy my Dictates and you

Motherfuckers might of thought this wasn't serious but

Guess what - I'll twist these words till you're delirious from

Tryna wrap your mind around the shit I'm pounding in your head

Till you give up and finally fucking hear what I said

With just words I'll conjure up the perfect storm for you

Subtle changes rearranging every angle to

Mention that my Magick ripped the fabric back then

In 2019

Epstein Voodoo

You're too late to stop me 2020 came and I dropped

Full Disclosure right before Covid Craziness locked

Down the whole fucking planet, god damn it - Why not

Distract us with more scare tactics - but Ghislaine got popped

Now I know you bitches hear me - Loud and Clear

My guerrillas in the trenches have surrounded you queers

No quarter - My orders say Exterminate

So I hate to inform you but there is no more debate

You can see the net closing in tightly but when

I spring this fucking trap that you're already in

Then you'll really get the picture of my problematic scripture

I am here with the elixir - drink it up, this shit'll fix ya

All warfare's deception so I had to be

An infection you neglected till you had to see

The results of my inception I am second to none

You never had enough weapons - I already won

The Devil's in the details

Here, let me sever the connection altogether - It's my pleasure

I am what you bitches fear
