## 🔊 Lyrics — Web Format

You forgot I'm him and I've always been  
You've got amnesia - You forgot I'm him  
You've got amnesia - You forgot I'm him  
You've got amnesia - You forgot I'm him  
You forgot I'm him and I've always been  

Look, I know you killed Pac  
Biggie and more - But you've never  
Had a motherfucker like me at your door  
But hear me clearly  
I won't let any of you bitches near me  
I'm knocking once before I bust in  
To make sure you whores feel me  
So I hope you know, it's much too late  
To run away - I'd fucking hate  
This gun to spray enough ammunition  
To cause a motherfucking cataclysmic  
Intervention that you bitches get to witness  
First hand - Pay attention  
I am him - have been and  
Always will - Cause this is real  
Do not mistake my lyrical  
Prowess as just another  
Simple idle threat  
Because I will fucking infect  
These airwaves like the Plague  
And conscript a Legion  
To delete your whole interior region  
I pledge Allegiance to Being  
The only reason these Demons  
Keep six hundred and sixty six feet in between us  
They know I'll extinguish  
Every ounce of heat  
That Satan keeps  
Around - You see how  
Cold my flow can get  
I'm Heaven sent - So don't forget  
No more - 'Til Hell freezes over  

You forgot I'm him and I've always been  
You've got amnesia - You forgot I'm him  
You've got amnesia - You forgot I'm him  
You've got amnesia - You forgot I'm him  
You forgot I'm him and I've always been  

Hell froze over - I'm no soldier  
I'm from Nova Scotia  
All we've got is snow & ice  
So no - I don't think I'll play nice  
Fuck your hierarchical order  
My entire life is more  
Than all the diamonds, gold and oil  
You can find - That's why  
I told you fucking swine  
Go find a cliff swan dive off it  
If you're pissed, it's fine  
I wrote this shit to benefit  
The innocent ignorant victims  
Listening to you and your men  
So with just this pen I intend  
To bring an end  
To complacency - Basically  
Once your Statist regime  
Sees me erasing every trace  
Of the debate - then you'll need  
A lot more dogma, propaganda  
Sedatives and a team  
Of loyal trusting citizens to  
Build pressure with - But see  
When I unloaded all devoted  
To your throne just broke free  
From the shackles that you told them  
Not to rattle - So we  
Are now like brothers whose mother  
Is fucking suffering under  
The hand of evil god damn  
Cowardly demonic hustlers  
So the plan - if you're wondering  
Is to stand and confront 'em  
Take back the land they were plundering  
And command everyone who didn't run  
To have fun combatting the Sun  
This war is over and has been  
Since I enlisted - I'm done  

You forgot I'm him and I've always been  
You've got amnesia - You forgot I'm him  
You've got amnesia - You forgot I'm him  
You've got amnesia - You forgot I'm him  
You forgot I'm him and I've always been

**Lyrical Dissection & Commentary**  
> Track: *I'm Him* — The Malicious EP (2024)  

*This track is the final revelation — a declaration of divine authorship and incarnated vengeance. “I’m Him” is not braggadocio — it’s a metaphysical reminder. The entire EP crescendos into this moment where Hawk Eye claims his role as both plague and purifier.*

> There’s no more warning here. No more metaphors.  
> Just the voice of someone who was silenced for lifetimes — finally unmuted.  

**You forgot he was Him.  
But He never did.**
