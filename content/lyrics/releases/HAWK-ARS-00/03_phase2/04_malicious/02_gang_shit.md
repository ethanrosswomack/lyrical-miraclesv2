## 🔊 Lyrics — Web Format

This is that "Fuck Your Life" type shit  
I'll Come murder you right quick and  
Kill off all your friends first, then  
I'll step up to this mic with these  
Lyrical Sirens (Bitch) Warning Shots I send  
Will hit you Pussy MotherFuckers  
With so much violence  

It's that "Fuck Your Life" type shit - I'll  
Come murder you right quick - but I'll  
Kill off all your friends first, then I'll  
Step up to this mic with these  
Lyrical Sirens 'cause Bitch these Warning Shots I send  
Will hit you pussy MotherFuckers  
With so much violence  

These words I wield as weapons  
Seem too real to even question  
And Bitch I will do more than threaten  
You with skillful rhythm sections  
I'll reveal my steel and make you feel  
The Thrill and teach you, basically  
You children better chill the fuck out  
Look - No One's safe with the  
Bird of Prey lurking - Out of sight  
Above 'em working  
High enough to fucking touch  
The Upper Crust - I'm bringing Thunder  
Don't you understand these Verses  
I am here to clear the Curses  
So don't ask me why I pulled up in a Hearse  
I'm killing worthless  
CockSuckin' old fucking asshole  
Political Puppets, Public Servants who deserve it  
Oh - and the Predatory Churches  
Social Services who purchase Kids  
And sell 'em to the Worst of Men  
You See, I want you all to Fucking Know  
It's Me when I come bursting in  

With that "Fuck Your Life" type shit - I'll  
Come murder you right quick - but I'll  
Kill off all your friends first, then I'll  
Step up to this mic with these  
Lyrical Sirens 'cause Bitch  
These Warning Shots I send  
Will hit you pussy MotherFuckers  
With so much violence  

It's that Gang Bang - Dope Slang  
I'll Hang you from a rope Language  
It's So fucking dangerous  
You better hope my flow changes  
And I don't say the Shit You Fear  
To let Anyone get to hear  
But Bitch - Let me be Krystal Klear  
My rhyme is equipped with Shifting Gears  
I simply twist each sentence  
Until it fits within Apprentices  
Ears - I slip that shit that  
Interferes and Resurrects  
My Tribe - Divine - You feel that Vibe  
I'll never let you germs infect  
The people whom you victimize  
Through mind controlling threats  
You bitches aren't as vicious  
As my Legion of Malicious  
Fire Breathing Dragons, when we take control  
But you will Witness  
How every Soul I brought with Me  
Won't fold or bend the knee  
I swear to God You MotherFuckers  
Aren't prepared for War with Me  

This is that "Fuck Your Life" type shit  
I'll Come murder you right quick and  
Kill off all your friends first, then  
Step up to this mic with these  
Lyrical Sirens (Bitch)  
Warning Shots I send  
Will hit you Pussy MotherFuckers  
With so much violence  

I'm gonna Warn you  
My Performance here  
Is not just Important  
To the people who support it  
Cause it Speaks to their Souls  
No - This is also where  
I keep you Squares  
From being the Elite Nightmare  
You pretend gangsters want to be  
You just don't seem so scary, See  
When Hawk Eye steps up to the Mic  
The air grows cold - Yo, kill the lights  
I'm who gets called to Win the Fight  
I End the War and then Ignite  
Invasive demonstrations against  
All of you Freemason  
Low Vibration, System Agents  
I have come here to replace  
Bitch I will kill you with words  
Like yo, listen to this Bird  
He says if We Unite  
There won't even be a fight  
Yeah that's right  
I speak to keep you Fuckers weak  
I'm what you need to hide, but see  
Shadow Banning didn't work  
So now it's time to End the Verse  
With shit too cryptic, Hieroglyphic  
Rhythmic Lyrics which I sent  
Rip through specific segmented sections  
Of the Veil that you didn't reinforce  
Before this Sorcery of mine took out defective  
Weak Links in your protective Mind Control System  
So Effective Immediately - I will need you to see  
The game is over - I have won - now please Bitch leave  

This is that "Fuck Your Life" type shit  
I'll Come murder you right quick and  
Kill off all your friends first, then  
I'll step up to this mic with these  
Lyrical Sirens - These Warning Shots I send  
Will hit you Pussy MotherFuckers  
With so much violence

**Lyrical Dissection & Commentary**  
> Track: *Gang Shit* — The Malicious EP (2024)  

*“Gang Shit” rips the mask off the elite’s most protected institutions and exposes their ugliest truths. This track is not just anti-establishment — it’s anti-predator. It targets the system’s sacred cows: police, judges, and state-sanctioned pedophile rings. Hawk Eye doesn’t generalize — he names the demons.*

> The delivery is militarized spoken word — equal parts battle cry, death spell, and psychic flamethrower. This is insurgent poetry for the post-disclosure age.

What *they* call gang activity?  
Hawk Eye reframes as spiritual justice.
