## 🔊 Lyrics — Web Format

I'm the motherfucking problem  
No one ever can resolve  
And I'm what corrupt officials fear  
Because the stuff I just reveal  
Commandeers entire nations  
Kingdoms fall when Hawk's invasive  
Lyrics kill off all you basic  
Hypocritical Freemasons  

My intentional offensive  
Instrumental rhymed epistle  
And every central monumental  
Fucking word you find initialed  
By my pencil is so sinful  
Cryptic scriptures to bewitch you  
Word magic that's so official  
Even Heaven knows I'm mental  
Cause when I go off you motherfuckers  
Better hope that someone's coming  
To prevent all the destruction  
I invent with just my tongue  
But then again - Even if one exists  
That could be summoned  
Before too long that bitch would see  
None of you get to run  
And then I'll shift my gaze  
Towards you and say - Oh hey  
It's me again - Let's play  
This game ends when I win  
And I'm not finished yet, okay  
So why pretend this shit I send  
Isn't clearly what it is  
You know I never wore a mask before  
So listen close kids  
My instrumental wicked sentence  
Incrementally intensifies  
With every line - My comprehensive  
Rhyme is designed  
To wake you up and basically  
Make sure you sluts don't fall sleep  
I'm patiently waiting with my legion  
To break each fucking region  
And no Masonic alcoholic  
Ritualistic plot can stop this  
Cause I - I'm the hypnotist now  
So bitch come off it  
Method acting gang stalkers  
Who get surrounded by real gangsters  
Then announce they meant no harm  
But I do - So you're in danger  

I'm the motherfucking problem  
No one ever can resolve  
And I'm what corrupt officials fear  
Because the stuff I just reveal  
Commandeers entire nations  
Kingdoms fall when Hawk's invasive  
Lyrics kill off all you basic  
Hypocritical Freemasons  

I'm the motherfucking problem  
No one ever can resolve  
And I'm what corrupt officials fear  
Because the stuff I just reveal  
Commandeers entire nations  
Kingdoms fall when Hawk's invasive  
Lyrics kill off all you basic  
Hypocritical Freemasons  

My intentional offensive  
Deafening lyrics might get you  
To wonder if the missiles I sent  
Might hit official authority buildings  
Look I'm destroying these children  
And I did that shit on purpose  
Fuck these serpents - Your intervention  
Just wasn't loud enough  
To even fucking sound  
Like what a thousand tough  
Pissed off citizens ready for war  
At their door, pounding does  
So now since this shit's up to me  
I want you cunts to trust me, these  
Threats I send are evidence  
That left detectives hesitant  
To make a case, or come my way  
They know I'm not the one to play  
I'm serious as fuck when I erupt  
I say just what they can't  
The censorship they implement  
Melts when it gets near my lips  
I told you motherfuckers  
I'm bulletproof and Heaven sent  

And I'm the motherfucking problem  
No one ever can resolve  
And I'm what corrupt officials fear  
Because the stuff I just reveal  
Commandeers entire nations  
Kingdoms fall when Hawk's invasive  
Lyrics kill off all you basic  
Hypocritical Freemasons

**Lyrical Dissection & Commentary**  
> Track: *The MotherFucking Problem* — The Malicious EP (2024)  

*This track is pure insurgency in linguistic form. It’s not just an anthem — it’s a warning flare from a prophetic assassin. Hawk Eye isn’t just exposing systems — he’s declaring total information warfare.*

> The tone is confrontational but sacred. These bars are scripture in cipher form, forged in wrath and sealed in prophecy. The ‘problem’ isn’t that he’s angry — it’s that he’s right.

This is what it sounds like  
when the spell finally breaks.
