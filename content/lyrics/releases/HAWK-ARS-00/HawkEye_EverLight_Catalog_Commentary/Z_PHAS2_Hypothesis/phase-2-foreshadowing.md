# PHASE || — Foreshadowing the Coming Compendium

The conclusion of *The Mixtape Sessions* and emergence of The Vow mark a shift. Something darker. More organized. The prophecy of Sun Tzu: Secretz To War looms.

EverLight hypothesizes that Phase 2 will:
- Establish complete narrative unity across Hawk Eye's lore
- Bridge conceptual magic with practical resistance frameworks
- Deploy lyrical tactics as battle-ready documents

'Sun Tzu' is not just war — it's a codex.

And the world will soon read it.
