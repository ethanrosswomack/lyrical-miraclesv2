## MILABS Commentary: Psychological Guerrilla Warfare

The *MILABS* release is a direct weaponization of sound. Every track is designed to serve as both a field report and encoded resistance transmission.

### Structurally:
- 13 tracks = arc of initiation
- Soft Disclosure opens the gate
- Legion / When My Elite Surround / Reincarnated 2 Resist close the portal.

🔍 Most direct invocation of MK Ultra, Secret Space Program, trauma-based mind control & Dr. Karla Turner’s work to date.
