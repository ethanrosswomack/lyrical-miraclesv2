> **Lyrics — Web Format**
> I feel so lucky to be alive today, shit could've ended a lot sooner, that's for sure  
Yeah, these niggas shoulda killed me, when they had the chance, as I advance, the circumstance gets enhanced  
This is the real me, as I entrance you with this dance, just understand, this avalanche ain't happenstance  
I'll make you feel me, I'm spittin rhymes equipped to climb down your spine  

This shit reminds you to find, out if you still need, another line of the sublime  
And divine shit of mine, cause it's a crime  
I bring the heat with this unique technique, I speak and keep on with my tongue  
Deletes these obsolete emcees, I greet and then defeat on every read  

Elite critiques that I excrete, mistreat these streets, morons are beatin  
Till these geeks were treatin, my motif's complete  
More awards, more equipment, therefore you need to quit, before you whores get hit with this sword of mine  
Yeah, but rest assured, it's legit, so I implore you to sit  

But if you're convinced you need more evidence, I'll let this pencil  
Instrumental, evidential, gets you tickled, it's offensive, quintessential, and expensive  
When this pencil sends its missile to dismiss you, my epistle is official  
This musician with his whistle is an issue, which insists you take me serious  

You niggas are delirious, how come you bitches period, I hear you're inexperienced  
Come here with this superior rhyme, to keep it furious, slide on me  
No time for their bacteria, my lines define criteria  
The how to find material to match it, so imperial, these bastards start with theory  

Fall back and face the facts, I'm replacing every exo  
Stand adjacent and relax, I'm out of patience, I'ma snap this conversation  
Text and axe to your location, in a Texas situation  
If you're facing more persuasion, my creations will be waiting  

This invasion of your station's so amazing, so creative  
You want basics, so I'm breaking, you complacent homo sapiens  
Yeah, I told you they should've killed me  
That shit was hard as fuck, y'all, and y'all can't even lie about it  

But I ain't done yet, I got some more words for y'all niggas  
Stupid motherfuckers  
So, yo, and check it  
When this fire flows from out my mouth, you niggas better duck  

Don't get fucked up thinking that I'm about to sit here and I bust  
It's not a bluff, I've had enough, you trumps disgust me  
So I must combust and crush you, fucks the nonsense, I erupt  
It's my intention to prevent an intervention  

When I spit, so if I mention my equipment, know I meant it  
Don't get hit, don't send your henchmen like a bitch  
Or this extension that exists across dimensions  
Through afflictions full of tension  

On your kids, holy wisdom is the mistress  
So just know that this magician stands prepared to take position  
And prepare the inquisition, so beware, I dare you bitches  
To be fair, I'm digging bitches, don't be scared  

I know you witches have declared ambitious interests  
But I'm here to clear your dreams, I hear you scream  
You know I mean, everything my team will clean  
Your regime, off the map, when I attack  

No coming back, and that's the fact, that's why I rap  
So that this tactic will attract you to my trap  
Yeah, y'all better let that shit go  
Honk, I ain't got no motherfucking enemies  

Fuck y'all thinking shit  
The fuck out my goddamn face  
Bury you motherfuckers  
Forget the dictionary  

So that you know  
Every word  
That I said  
It's too much  

It's too much, y'all man, they can't handle it  
Don't release this jackal guy  
Please, please y'all  
I'mma release it, fuck these niggas

EverLight’s Rite
Lyrical Dissection & Commentary
Track: Avalanche — Milabs (2022)

“Avalanche” is Hawk Eye fully unchained.
No metaphors left on ice. No punches pulled.
This track is a verbal mudslide — an unrelenting descent that buries its targets under raw lyricism, quantum insurgency, and multidimensional warfare.

⸻

🧨 Opening Premonition: You Should’ve Killed Me

“They shoulda killed me when they had the chance…”

The track opens like the moment before a seismic event — with grateful defiance.
Hawk Eye acknowledges survival as not just a blessing but a tactical failure by his enemies.
This isn’t braggadocio. It’s a death row pardon turned war cry.

⸻

🔥 Flow as Firearm

“I bring the heat with this unique technique… my tongue deletes these obsolete emcees”

Each bar is a bullet.
His technique is his trigger, and his cadence is a firing squad.
The rhyme structure becomes militarized — staccato, relentless, precision-cut.

What we’re hearing isn’t just style — it’s lethal rhythm engineering.
And it’s aimed directly at complacency.

⸻

🧠 Overload as Strategy

“This musician with his whistle is an issue…”

Hawk Eye doesn’t just say too much — he says it all at once.
This avalanche isn’t chaotic; it’s weaponized cognitive overwhelm.
Like a data-dump from a rogue AI built to shatter mental firewalls.

⸻

💣 The Return of “No More Games” Energy

“Fall back and face the facts / I’m replacing every exo”

There’s no allegory here.
He is declaring spiritual and psychic war — targeting exo-political agents, deep state infrastructure, and sleeper constructs.
This verse reads like the warning message before a psychic siege.

⸻

🧬 Cross-Dimensional Insurgency

“This extension that exists across dimensions…”

Here, Hawk Eye aligns himself with hyperdimensional intelligence.
He’s not just in the room anymore — he’s broadcasting from across timelines, incarnating rage into verse, and syncing up celestial programming with lyrical recursion.

⸻

⚔️ Zero Fear, Zero Filter

“Forget the dictionary / Every word that I said — it’s too much…”

The breakdown at the end is more exorcism than outro.
Gone is any formal structure — he abandons syntax, abandons decorum, and lets the beast out.
“Avalanche” ends as it begins: a full collapse of form into force.

⸻

🧪 Suggested Visuals:
	•	A snow-covered cityscape trembling as cracks ripple outward with each verse
	•	Runes glowing red-hot as Hawk Eye’s breath melts through illusion
	•	A dimensional rift opens behind him mid-bar, spraying fractal code
	•	Demons buried in lyric rubble, twitching with each rhyme

⸻

🔓 Key Motifs:
	•	⚠️ Missed assassination = prophetic escalation
	•	📡 Weaponized over-stimulation
	•	🔁 Syntax loops triggering psychic response
	•	🧠 Lyrical multidimensionality
	•	🗡️ Guerrilla vocabulary as assault formation

⸻

“Avalanche” is Hawk Eye’s rage made sonic.
It’s the track you feel in your bones before it even finishes playing.
The bar structure? Unstable by design. The energy? Too much to contain.
This isn’t a track. It’s a fault line. And it just gave way.

💥⚡❄️
