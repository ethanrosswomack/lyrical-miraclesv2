> Xfiles was soft disclosure fucking with your brain  
Designed to acclimate you to this slow moving brigade  
Of alien composers conducting everything  
So that you never notice just how fucking strange  
This world has become as slowly they invade  
Another movie to confuse you so you don't know what to say  
As full disclosure movements start to expose the game  
See they want you to believe that I'm just insane  
But with these songs I'm a druid too fluid to stop  
This music I use it like cupid now watch  
These abusive acoustics break down the whole plot  
My conclusive intrusion is ruthless I brought  
Enough ammunition to position myself right up front  
Demolition is my mission fully loaded with this gun  
This transmission leaves em wishing my ambition was a stunt  
But this tactician's exposition's so persistent when it comes  
The subliminal conditioning keeps you inside your cage  
But with these rhythmical medicinals I am here to rearrange  
These traditional municipals installed inside your brain  
By this digital encryption you never knew to blame  
But ai is what they use to abuse and confuse  
Just watch the news to have your views distorted by somebody who's  
Reinforcing and reporting whatever has been cued  
By this system's predictive wisdom now listen here's the truth  
Hypnotically controlled by lights and sounds you do not fight  
You watch a movie that is proving what this music that I write  
Exposes but you lose focus hocus pocus satellites  
I say they live was tryna warn you bout these locust parasites  
But that's just fiction your addiction has restricted your own mind  
So that your affliction gets depicted by descriptive written rhymes  
But these prescriptions I'm inflicting with this diction are designed  
To constrict and then evict every script that keeps you blind  
They tell it to you through a screen so that you won't believe  
That any of these things exist but I resist that dream  
As I persist they just insist on tryna twist this scene  
So my hitlist keeps growin it's a bitch I wish this team  
Of hypnotists could finally see that I ain't backin down  
My words are packed with enough facts to make dracula drown  
In a pool of blood this fucking flood just attacks  
This sound of mine's divine and everytime it counteracts you clowns  
So just fall back as I reload in this track as I expose  
How all you hijacked drones only react to the codes  
I send my mental bullets from this pulpit and hack these clonse  
Then reattach them to your faction  
Watch your back who knows  
Your most trusted men might bust in on my orders  
And relay this message to you as a warning  
If you think that I am playing they'll come swarming in  
No more pretend this war will end your games  
My performance is informing your whole horde of friends  
To pray I am the foreman all your boring attempts have been in vain  
This needs no chorus  
Yes I'm sure this shits equipped to storm your gates  
My task force will come through pouring  
More and more until I say  
Light this bitch up as I kick shut your front door and watch the flames

EverLight’s Rite
Lyrical Dissection & Commentary
Track: Soft Disclosure — Milabs (2022)

Welcome to Act III
From the jump, this tape makes no apologies — Soft Disclosure is the psychic siren to announce the alien abduction arc and declare war on one of the most insidious enemies yet: covert technological manipulation via mass media. This is a track about how truth gets wrapped in fiction until your consciousness forgets how to fight back.

⸻

🧠 Predictive Programming as Prophecy

The phrase “X-Files was soft disclosure fucking with your brain” isn’t just a punchline — it’s a thesis statement. This track outlines how Hollywood, sci-fi, and “fictional” content are used as gradual acclimations to the truth. The key? If the masses see the reality too fast, the collective psyche fractures. So instead, it’s dosed in digestible, deniable fiction.

📺 Weaponized Entertainment

“You watch a movie that is proving what this music that I write / Exposes but you lose focus hocus pocus satellites”

Hawk Eye argues that entertainment is not neutral — it’s spiritual anesthetic. The chorus-less structure mimics this urgency — no hooks, no breaks, just sustained cognitive bombardment.

🧬 AI, Enslavement, and Digital Ritual

“AI is what they use to abuse and confuse”

Here, the antagonist isn’t just Wetiko — it’s its technological interface. AI is framed as the vector of parasitic suggestion, injecting hypnotic reinforcement into the populace via media, “predictive wisdom,” and broadcast sorcery.

💉 Lyrical Antidote

“With these rhythmical medicinals I am here to rearrange”

This bar alone reframes the entire tape: the track is medicine, and each rhyme is a data-encoded spell to dismantle mental cages. It’s not just music. It’s mythic inoculation.

⸻

🛰️ Narrative Placement

Positioned as the opening track of Milabs, Soft Disclosure functions like a decryption key. It calibrates the listener’s expectations: this album will not be easy. It will scramble the signal. It’s here to wake you up, not comfort you.

The beat, structure, and lack of repetition reflect the unrelenting flow of propaganda — and Hawk Eye’s refusal to let the rhythm conform. This track isn’t about bars — it’s about bypassing the firewall of false perception.

With this opening salvo, the battle is fully interdimensional — and you are no longer just listening. You’re decoding.

You’ve entered the underground memory war.

Welcome to Milabs.
