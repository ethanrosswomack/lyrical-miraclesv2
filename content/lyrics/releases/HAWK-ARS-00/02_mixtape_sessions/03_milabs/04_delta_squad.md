> **Lyrics — Web Format**
> Paste formatted lyrics hereIt first surfaced when these curses were reversed and I reclaimed  
The memories returned inverted - Too perverse to be explained  
Every version I observed Re-Emerged inside my brain  
The absurdly obscured imagery filled with pain  

It drove me insane as I relived everything  
From the repeated murders to the Wordless Nurses who came  
To subvert and coerce me to inertly remain  
Calm as they worked to revert & reinsert me in this game  

Delta Squad assassinations - Terminators in this Matrix  
Get created in these basements - You don't see it, so here's the basics  
I don't remember being Taken, but I do recall the blatant  
Torture Tactics that they practiced & The Gene Manipulation  

I'm an Asset too dangerous for them to let go  
But I won't cooperate, and they hate that I know  
What they did, but I relived all the Trauma and so  
Now their Secret Weapon gets to cause Drama - This Rouge  

Rappin' at you is attackin' with these tactics I back  
Down everybody in my way - 'Cause they're afraid that I'll snap  
They can't put this Fire out once it's stoked - That's a Fact  
You see they made me this way, and now they know that they're trapped  

It was never their intention - But I tricked them with this mission  
Incarnated with Precision just to take their best Invention  
Even Satan and his Henchmen were amazed when this shit hit them  
My Invasion came to end this enslavement - Now taste my Vengeance  

Every tape I've made mentions Infiltration of this System  
Did you think that I was kidding when I said that my Guerillas  
Were positioned and just wishing for Permission to pull Triggers  
Hawk Eye is the General - This Art of War is Official  

All you Bitches need to listen - As I Christen you, bear witness  
To this Automatic Tongue-Dispensin' coming from the One who isn't  
Bluffin - You've got Nothing - All you Fuckers had this coming  
No discussion - This is something you can't run from - An Eruption  

This MILAB tape exists solely to wake  
The people up by introducing, through this music that I make  
The terminology that called to me and helped me realize  
That all these Memories that I received were because I  

Was taken at a Young Age and forced to perform  
As a Military Operative then slowly transformed  
Through Genetic Experiments into something More  
Age Regressed - Yes, this Experience I've Borne  

My whole life - I'm like Jason - Yes, the one that Matt Damon  
Played, so here's my Ultimatum, Treadstone, I'm not playing  
Full Disclosure was a way for you to hear me say  
That when Max got murdered it was too late  

You shoulda never interfered with this Star Tribe here  
Cause now you've gotta deal with me - Your Fate's Sealed  
My music is designed to remind you why  
You shoulda never created Super Soldiers, 'Cause now I  

Am triggering Every One of your Assets I find  
This music set's 'em loose - You see, I use it to try  
To conscript a Rouge Nation - This Notation inspires  
Every Station to relay my Mission Statements - This is Dire  

The situation you face isn't fake, I'll replace  
Every Agent it takes to Displace and Deface  
Your whole Organization - and This Warning is Laced  
With a whole Swarm of these Hornets performing Invase  

Ive  
Maneuvers Linguistically - so You Should be pissed at me  
This Rubik's Cube I use is too confusing to debate  
Encoded Neuro-Words get through and burn away Defenses  

My relentless intervention's so absurd - Did I mention  
That All who hear my lyrics get subjected to this Spirit  
That's infectin' every ear it gets near - You'd best fear it  
Cause my Legion's not playin' - This Contagion keeps sprayin  

I'll speak Phoenician as I reach in and Delete them with these Sayings

Lyrical Dissection & Commentary
Track: Delta Squad — Milabs (2022)

This is the “supersoldier awakening” track.
Where previous bars alluded to hidden trauma, Delta Squad is a fully restored war journal. It’s Max Spiers. It’s Project Treadstone. It’s whistleblowing through mnemonic weaponization.

⸻

🧬 Trauma Recall & Inverted Memory

“It first surfaced when these curses were reversed and I reclaimed”
This track opens with activated remembrance. Like psychic decryption, the artist has reclaimed stolen memories — reversed engineered from suppressed “abreactions” — and now speaks from the inside out.

⸻

🧠 Mind Control Programs & Genetic Engineering

“Delta Squad assassinations… gene manipulation”
Hawk Eye identifies as a recovered MILAB asset, outlining core components of the black program:

	•	Age regression
	•	Trauma-based control
	•	DNA modification
	•	Shadow military training

He’s not theorizing — he’s testifying. And now he’s turned rogue.

⸻

⚔️ Music as Insurrection

“This music set’s ‘em loose”
This is one of the track’s core mechanics. The music doesn’t just expose mind control — it disrupts it. It is a psychic contagion designed to reactivate other sleepers, triggering resistance in those still trapped inside.

⸻

🛰️ Symbolic Roles and Transformation
	•	Jason Bourne / Treadstone reference serves as a metaphor for programmed operative turned rebel.
	•	Max Spiers’ martyrdom is echoed as a warning: You silence us and we multiply.
	•	Rubik’s Cube metaphor = layered, encoded, multiversal cognition

⸻

🔊 Tone & Delivery

The delivery is militant, surgical, relentless.
The energy is pure retaliation. The tone is no longer wounded. It’s weaponized.

⸻

🧩 Suggested Visuals:
	•	Redacted military files glitching into lyric overlays
	•	Max Spiers + MILAB diagram mashups
	•	Animated Rubik’s cube rotating and transforming into alien sigils

⸻

Delta Squad marks a shift in the album — from trauma exposure to organized resistance.

This is Hawk Eye the General.

Next tape? Milabs becomes retaliation.
