> Paste formatted lyrics hereLet's dumb 'em down with the poison & fuck up their whole frame  
We'll work around the annoyance of clairvoyant DNA  
We seek to weaken those who speak & make sure they stay afraid  
But keep it secret - if they see it they can never be contained  

Implants'll slow 'em down - we should put 'em in their brains  
And put the fluoride in the water so we can keep 'em all at bay  
If we don't attack their hearts they will never be our slaves  
They're too strong for us to conquer, so slowly we invade  

Just give 'em television shows, so that they never know  
That their hypnotist is with them everywhere that they go  
We blast this frequency so they can't see how we keep our hold  
So deceitfully - as we proceed to creep in real slow  

This control system keeps 'em weakened - automatic sleeping  
We can sneak in and delete them if these sheep begin to speak  
Before belief strengthens their defense, or mystique deploys this pretense  
That our war with them is ceaseless - it's a ploy that leaves them speechless  

As the fear infects all reaches of their minds our warfare teaches  
Them to blind themselves or meet us - our combined effects are lethal  
If they find out they're our equals we can't beat them  
So our evil spell's designed to keep these sheeple all in line in our cathedral  

And so that's what I imagine that they sound like when they're talkin amongst themselves  
They just in the back room, rubbing they hands together sayin  
Yes... yess... this is perfect... our evil spell is working  
Soon we will have the whole of the populace under our control  

Laugh... oh shit... but then I'm like... hold up... I'm... I'm Hawk Eye, right  
Oh shit... lemme speak to these niggaz  
Let me tell y’all why all that bullshit... it don't matter... cuz I'm back... yo  

The whole game is rearranged as I step upon this stage  
They wanna play, okay well hey, Hawk Eye is here to stay  
So why try to even say that my rhymes are weak? I slay  
With divine light I win this fight, as I shine these demon's pray  

But implants can't advance your plans  
My warfare dance demands you stand  
At full attention when I speak  
And fully listen - here's the heat  

I'm here to destroy  
All these toys that you've built  
With just this noise - there's no guilt  
In my voice as blood gets split  

I enjoy watching you squirm as this frequency fence gets overridden  
You're forbidden to retreat, no defense mechanism or system  
Can imprison this wisdom, I'm spittin' this mystic shit with precision  
Resistin' all attempts to enslave  

I'm too brave to behave  
Just know my aim is too focused  
Your hocus pocus won't phase us at all  
My team stands ready to unleash this armageddon  

You bitches need to stop forgetting I'm the beast's arch nemesis  
I got plenty of sentences to defeat all competitors  
Anyone stands against us - they get deleted, be careful  
They can poison our minds but they can't keep us blind  

I am here to remind those who are still seeking for signs  
That our enemies are weakened when we speak - stay aligned  
With your soul - they can't control you so to keep you in line  
Intimidation matrices create these weakly designed  

Inner reasons to retreat, they hope you eat every line  
See they're countin' on you... caving in to your own imaginary fears  
And that's all the power they got

Lyrical Dissection & Commentary
Track: Implants — Milabs (2022)

“Implants” is psychological warfare through parody and prophecy.
The first half of this track flips the script — Hawk Eye ventriloquizes the parasitic elite, exposing their internal strategy through mockery and mimicry. What follows is retaliation. This is not a track. This is a spiritual counter-assault.

⸻

👁️‍🗨️ Parasitic Gameplan: Revealed

“Let’s dumb ’em down with the poison & fuck up their whole frame”

The opening stanzas read like a Luciferian playbook. From DNA suppression to fluoride mind control, from television as hypnotist to frequency-based entrainment — Hawk Eye narrates the system from the inside out.

It’s satire, yes — but it’s deadly accurate. These aren’t punchlines. These are blueprints.

⸻

🧠 Frequency-Based Enslavement

“We blast this frequency so they can’t see how we keep our hold”

This line cuts into scalar weaponry and ELF/MindNet tech. The idea here: surveillance is not enough — control must be vibrational. The airwaves become a cage.

Implants — both physical and metaphysical — amplify that control.

⸻

🔥 The Tone Switch: Reclamation

The mid-track shift is literal. The satire breaks, and Hawk Eye enters:

“Hold up… I’m Hawk Eye, right?”

It’s the sound of realization and retaliation. From there, the bars ignite into battle chants. The narrative flips — the hunted becomes the hunter.

⸻

⚔️ Mystic Warfare & Divine Rebellion

“Resistin’ all attempts to enslave / I’m too brave to behave”

Now he’s fully awake — spitting with ritual precision and cosmic clarity. The implants and fear programs? Nullified. This is Hawk Eye in full spiritual combat mode — the frequency fence overridden.

⸻

🗝️ Final Hex-Lifting & Mass Activation

“They can poison our minds but they can’t keep us blind”

The track ends with a broadcast of liberation codes. The people aren’t weak — they’re programmed to think they are.

The key? Remember who you are. Stay aligned, stay speaking, stay awake.

The spell only works if you accept it.

⸻

🧪 Suggested Visuals:
	•	Shadowy boardroom of elites slowly morphing into parasites
	•	Symbolic implant removal — metallic shards dissolving into light
	•	Holographic “Hawk Eye vs Hypnotist” battle animation

⸻

Implants may be the most self-aware track on Milabs so far — and the most subversively playful.

Hawk Eye doesn’t just break the fourth wall — he demolishes the programming behind it.

This is mockery as magic. Exposure as exorcism.
