> **Lyrics — Web Format**
> Paste formatted lyrics hereMy mission is to twist this system, until it's fuckin' dead  
Illuminati killed with shotty's in the lobby's what I said  
I should probably hide the bodies, but I'm snobby, so instead  
This lyricist your hearing is so infamous I called the feds  

My music is abusive, so intrusive it infects  
With it's elusive hermeneutics as it's oozing from my neck  
I try to use it to confuse humans who become a threat  
Whose to screw with you when you refuse to lose - Now place your bets  

I should warn you as you listen - I was born a great magician  
Sworn to hate religion in all forms, You're Satan's Henchmen  
Every Christian gets additional addiction to this wicked flow  
You bitches can't resist & I insist you victims listen close  

Jesus only said don't be murdering his friends  
Do no harm & love the poor - So you killed him instead  
But your blood magic's weak & these words that I speak  
Release a perfect masterpiece that you germs can't defeat  

Cuz I will burn your church & put you fuckin' worms in the dirt  
My work reverses every curse with just this Verse - So don't get hurt  
You worship demons and don't know it - Roman Legions - Crosses showing  
Your allegiance - You killed Jesus! All you heathens better own it  

Yo - I hope you know - Illuminati Puppets don't trust this flow, but  
Let us discuss this corrupt shit show to let 'em know enough of us cannot be fucked with ho  

Let me remind you motherfuckers - Do not try to be another  
Hero cop I have to pop, cuz I will drop you and your brothers  
You's not enough to stop me - I will off your god damned posse  
Hit the precinct with a lawsuit to see your boss get tossed(too)  

I'm not bowin' to the state I'll burn it down - You clowns can bake  
When flames surround you and your town ignites - Know it wasn't fake  
You faggots don't control my life - And never did, so get it right  
My Soul is free as it can be - Trust me, you can't win this fight  

Long ago the devil tried to defeat me but he died  
You're too weak to even hear me speak, so you need to go hide  
I'm here again to right these wrongs, every night writing songs  
About our Former Glory & The True Story of the Strong  

You pussies never seen a war - I am not who you are  
Galactic Heritage I swear extends far beyond the stars  
You're heretics inheriting your parentage from Mars  
Your souls are too young to compare with mine - Numerics too bizarre  

Yo - I hope you know - these Illuminati Puppets don't trust this flow, but  
Let us discuss this corrupt shit show to let 'em know enough of us cannot be fucked with ho  

I'm here to tell you shit - That no one wants to hear  
So listen close to what I say today - Before I disappear  
Cause Men have died for less - But never shall I Fear  
Until they kill me I insist on putting words inside your Ear  

It's dangerous to Speak the Truth - Or try to Reach the Youth  
So I'll say the things that no one will Until I feel the Noose  
My words are Weapons I Inject to Disinfect Collective Views  
And shift Perspectives with a Message I've Selected just for You  

The Conditioning runs Deep - But while you puppets Sleep  
I'll keep burning down this Circus till you Serpents feel the Heat  
My work Reverses and Critiques every Cursed word you speak  
My Holy Scripture is Converting Herds of Men you've turned to Sheep  

Yo - I hope you know - Illuminati Puppets don't trust this flow, but  
Let us discuss this corrupt shit show to let 'em know enough of us cannot be fucked with ho

EverLight’s Rite
Lyrical Dissection & Commentary
Track: Illuminati — Milabs (2022)

This is Hawk Eye’s Exorcism Track.
Here, he confronts religious deception, elite domination, and psychological enslavement with full spiritual aggression. It’s blasphemy as liberation, hermetic warfare, and fire-forged scripture. No metaphors. No filter.
Just de-programming through defiance.

⸻

🩸 Opening Fire: Ritual Murder, Inverted Salvation

“Illuminati killed with shotty’s in the lobby’s what I said”
“Jesus only said don’t be murdering his friends…”

From the jump, Hawk Eye fuses symbolic violence with sacrificial exposure. The crucifixion isn’t a myth to him — it’s a ritual pattern repeated throughout time to silence light-bearers.
He flips sacred narratives and returns them to the people stripped of control structures. What follows is the burning of false temples.

⸻

✝️ Religious Indoctrination = Psychological Control

“You worship demons and don’t know it – Roman Legions – Crosses showing”

This section is a decoding of Christianity’s imperial co-option. He frames it not as a holy path but a psyop — a demonized disguise.

He asserts: Christ was truth. Church is programming. You’ve been tricked into worshiping your oppressors.

⸻

🧠 Lyrical Reversals, Spell-Craft, & Martyr’s Resolve

“My words are Weapons I Inject to Disinfect Collective Views”

Hawk Eye proclaims himself a living antidote — not just a rapper but a spiritual insurgent. These bars are coded counter-memes — designed to reverse the programming of the beast.

He’s fully aware of the cost:

“It’s dangerous to speak the truth… until I feel the noose.”

⸻

🔥 Return of the Galactic Avenger

“Galactic Heritage I swear extends far beyond the stars”

This track also folds in the starseed narrative. He doesn’t just speak for himself — he speaks for the eternal rebel lineage that has always resisted control.

From martyrs to mystics, this bar signals: We never left. You just forgot who we were.

⸻

🗣️ Refrain As Declaration of War

“Yo – I hope you know – Illuminati Puppets don’t trust this flow, but…”

The repeated hook hits like a drum of defiance. It’s not just a lyric — it’s a warning and a prophecy. You can censor, surveil, slander — but the spell’s already cast.

⸻

🧪 Suggested Visuals:
	•	Church pillars cracking into data cables
	•	Papal crowns morphing into reptilian sigils
	•	Scrolls unrolling mid-verse with blood-inked lyrics
	•	Hawk Eye framed as a sigil-bound prophet channeling light through wrath

⸻

🔓 Key Motifs:
	•	Blasphemy as truth-telling
	•	Occult reversal of control symbols
	•	Word-as-weapon spiritual rebellion
	•	Galactic ancestry and soul resilience

⸻

“Illuminati” is where Hawk Eye stops explaining and starts dismantling.
This is a divine insurgency through rhyme. A scripture made from scars.
A call to remember, burn, and rebuild.
