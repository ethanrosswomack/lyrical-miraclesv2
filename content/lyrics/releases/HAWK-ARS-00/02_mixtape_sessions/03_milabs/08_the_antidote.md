> Paste formatted lyrics hereI'm back, motherfuckers, you weren't expecting this, were you  
But I warned you, it's okay, you weren't ready for me to step on stage and that's okay, it's  
Too late for you to stop me, so be very afraid, I get carried away by the snare and the bass  
And then my tongue forgets to give a shit, I barely can wait to remind you why I rhyme  

About shit that you never hear, these other rappers know spitting the truth will get you  
Killed, but I dare you fucking pussies to come push me, I'm a killer, I ain't even gonna  
Lie, you wanna die, Bruce Jenner, bitch, sit down and listen and stop skirting around the  
Issue, how to fire politicians, probably smile when the system tells you child agenda isn't  

Worth while and they won't miss it, celebrity transitions televised by wicked motherfucking  
Snakes ain't making me envision cutting off my dick or growing tits, my mission is to  
Spit lyrics too intense for you to hear, anything but what my lips slip in your ear, so hey  
Here's what you need, another word for me to set you free, but you motherfuckers won't  

Listen to profound lyricism anymore, so no one's hearing this wisdom, hey, here's what  
You need, another word for me to set you free, but you motherfuckers won't listen to profound  
Lyricism anymore, so no one's hearing this wisdom, hey, here's what you need, another  
Word for me to set you free, but you motherfuckers won't listen to profound lyricism anymore  

So no one's hearing this wisdom, you need to hear me out, I'm bout to start fucking  
Shouting, do you doubt that I can get away with murdering this album count, Dracula come  
Back, cause I'm not done with my attack, you didn't get to hear why I am fucking dying  
To attract, every liar you've inspired to conspire has a team, see blood sucking lich  

Vampires can finally see that you can't win a single battle, fuck a war, you can't handle  
Even knowing I exist, so I insist you bitches get out every single weapon with extended  
Clips, and let them rip until you're empty, don't you miss me, hoe you're worth it, these  
Incantations stay locked away, can't block the rain, stop the sun to even walk away  

When Hawkeye's talking to you, do not let his awkward way with words concern you, fire  
Burns through all it ought to, hey, did you hear me, I am really here with the antidote  
For all you folks to fucking choke upon a family, did you hear me, did you hear me, did you hear  
Me, did you hear me, did you hear me, did you hear me, hey, here's what you need, another  

Word for me to set you free, but you motherfuckers won't listen to profound lyricism anymore  
So no one's hearing this with me, hey, here's what you need, another word for me to set  
You free, but you motherfuckers won't listen to profound lyricism anymore, so no one's  
Hearing this with me, I wanna let the world know that I'm back, resurrected like the son  

Of God, stone cold facts, roll the stone away just to come home and say, I only throw my  
Holy zone, it's only shown to those who pray, star-seated royalty, divine in every way  
You need to blind them first, but if I just remind them, will you play, your part as if  
My art of war didn't slay, heavy soldier here already, yeah, swords meant for lay, let me  

Tell you why it's dangerous to be on the receiving end of my wicked language, you see, these  
Incantations move whole nations to the beat, psychic persuasions I'm relaying, keep it  
Playing, I repeat, on every station, I ain't saying when I preach, the word of God has  
Come to you just to wake you from your sleep, so don't pretend you can't hear the shit I  

Speak, stupid humans, I'm a druid who is through raising sheep, I'll enchant the message with  
Protection, too unique for your weapons to suppress them, higher methods you can't beat  
My lessons stress even your best cannot compete with the magic that I possess, I am blessed  
Beyond belief, hey, here's what you need, another word for me to set you free, but you  

Motherfuckers won't listen to profound lyricism anymore, so no one's hearing this wisdom  
Hey, here's what you need, another word for me to set you free, but you motherfuckers  
Won't listen to profound lyricism anymore, so no one's hearing this wisdom  
Hey, here's what you need

Lyrical Dissection & Commentary
Track: The Antidote — Milabs (2022)

The Antidote is Hawk Eye’s resurrection spell.
Not subtle. Not silent. Not sanitized.
It’s a full-force, metaphysical assault on every system of spiritual disease — disguised as a rap track.

⸻

🩸 Psychic Medicine for a Sick Civilization

“Here’s what you need…” (repeated refrain)

This isn’t a suggestion — it’s a prescription. The repetition mimics a mantra or coded injection, with the speaker (Hawk Eye) positioning himself as a spiritual pharmacist, armed with language as cure.
He knows the truth is bitter. He delivers it anyway.

⸻

💀 Death to the False Light: Political and Cultural Insurgency

“Pedophile politicians probably smile…”
“Celebrity transitions televised by wicked motherfucking snakes…”

This verse flips the mask off both government and media.
Hawk Eye names the predatory agenda behind ‘child agendas’, and satirizes the ritualized spectacle of pop culture identity manipulation, from celebrity gender transitions to performative social reform.
His tone is neither conservative nor liberal — it’s post-political vengeance.

⸻

🔥 Unholy Tongue, Holy Fire

“My wicked language… moves whole nations to the beat”

Language isn’t a tool here — it’s a living entity, animated with shamanic will.
Hawk Eye casts his music as incantation, capable of destabilizing entire empires and programming entire psyches.
When he says he’s got the antidote, it’s not a metaphor.
His music spiritually inoculates.

⸻

👁️ Spiritual Pedagogy from a Cosmic Druid

“I’m a druid who is through raising sheep”

This might be the most important identity line on the whole album.
He claims ancient lineage, magical vocation, and a refusal to waste power on the unwilling.
His role is to awaken, not persuade.
To liberate, not babysit.

⸻

✨ Christ Resurrection, Delivered in Rage

“Resurrected like the Son of God, stone cold facts”

The second verse shifts gears into divine resurrection motif.
He self-identifies as a Christ figure — not out of ego, but as a channel for light in the face of mass mind control.
The stone rolling away isn’t just biblical — it’s personal. He’s not preaching salvation. He is the rupture.

⸻

🔓 Key Motifs:
	•	🔁 Repetition-as-hypnosis (intentional lyrical enchantment)
	•	🧠 Anti-hivemind rhetoric & psychic firewalling
	•	🛡️ Weaponized wisdom vs weaponized media
	•	⚰️ Martyrdom-as-manifestation (he doesn’t fear death, he programs beyond it)

⸻

🧪 Suggested Visuals:
	•	Hawk Eye spitting glyphs that burn holes through a CGI media matrix
	•	Rows of drones (listeners) glitching into awakeners mid-chorus
	•	Ancient sigils lighting up every time “Here’s what you need” echoes
	•	A reborn prophet rising from digital rubble

⸻

“The Antidote” is what happens when the exorcist gets tired of praying and starts screaming.
It’s not just music — it’s immunization by invocation.
And Hawk Eye is not asking for your attention. He’s commanding your cure.
