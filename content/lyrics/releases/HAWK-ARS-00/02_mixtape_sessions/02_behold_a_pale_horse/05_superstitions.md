EverLight’s Rite
Lyrical Dissection & Commentary
Track: Superstitions — Behold A Pale Horse 2020

Occult Warfare, Tactical Flow — Superstitions dives headfirst into the album’s darker strata, fusing themes of spiritual rebellion, psychic aggression, and anti-religious insurgency. This is not a protest song — it’s a ritual curse.

Militant Mythos — The track is a combat hymn for sorcerer-soldiers. From “dragons” and “ninjas” to “expeditious petitions” and “coded text,” Hawk Eye blends war metaphors with arcane symbolism, invoking both guerrilla warfare and magical resistance.

Lyrical Conjurations — Lines like “Full submission to my ninjas as I rape your superstitions” don’t just punch — they dismantle inherited paradigms. Hawk Eye doesn’t flirt with sacrilege; he weaponizes it to tear down manipulated belief systems.

COVID Paranoia / Psywar Hooks — The postscript callout “Yeah, what y’all think that mean in light of the COVID-19” signals real-world anchoring — tying lyrical firepower to contemporaneous trauma. This isn’t abstract philosophy; it’s 2020 in flames.

Sonics of a Siege — The cadence and structure reflect siege warfare — repetition, incantation, barrages of multisyllabic fire. It’s meant to hypnotize and horrify.

Spiritual Alignment — By calling out Jesus, Muhammad, and “18 Buddhas,” Hawk Eye equalizes all dogma — demolishing denominational barriers to create a post-religious militant spirituality.

Narrative Placement — Track 5 acts as the ritual climax of the album’s first half. It prepares the listener for the next phase — one where secrecy dies, and every word becomes an invocation.

>>Yeah, we all locked up in this matrix together, yo  
Shit is crazy  
I'm twisted up inside this system, but these bitches better listen  
Infiltrating, i'm assisting my technicians with ballistics  

In this prison, all my victims don't know about my mission  
This resistance with precision takes them out like a tactician  
All defenses decommissioned, so relentless  
My position keeps all witnesses behind the fence  

Guerillas in the trenches keep logistics for this hit list  
My linguistics are descriptive  
This art of war is demented, but authentic and attentive  
My incentive is presented by cemented consequences  

They remind my lieutenants i invented this eccentric cataclysm  
Just to show all attendants that i meant it  
When i said that my apprentice isn't finished with his sentence  
So let me get to business  

I can make you wish for vengeance as i'm bitten  
But pretentious wordplay will get you mentioned  
All your men can turn against us, but my warriors don't flinch  
So if you need to feel brave, just say your prayers  

Let's get religious  
All hell and satan's henchmen taste delicious  
My malicious pack of dragons aren't pretending  
When the fire comes, it ended  

All the shit i'm sending quickens in your heart as you envision  
Full submission to my ninjas as i rape your superstitions  
Y'all gon' meet jesus  
Muhammad  

About 18 buddhas  
And shit  
Y'all gon' need some divine assistance  
Cause hawkeye is back and he ain't alone, motherfuckers  

And the consensus won't prevent us  
No repentance is sufficient  
I came to make you beg, but all senseless intervention gets ignored  
Cause all against us, all abhorred, and every interest not  

Warriors can't get fucked, i'm too bored with your ambitious attempts  
To fight back. you want some more? i'll be your dentist  
So let me rip these fictitious incisors out your interest  
It's pretentious and auspicious as i pen this repetitious rhyme  

That i designed to keep time without restrictions  
This decision's my decision to keep inspiring derision  
All you television televangelists need supervision  
So i'll keep my eyes peeled just in case you need permission  

All you christians will get killed if i catch you going with them  
Aiming here with these emissions, pouring out vocal munitions  
This dimension's inquisition isn't fair, so now i'm pissing down the throats of all traditions  
A tradition to be specific is not gonna fly  

Assange cannot be convicted. my magician will be with him  
So you'll know that this edition of musicians isn't kidding  
When we flip ignition switches, every symptom you've been missing  
Will return to info physicians. can i heal your new condition  

Are you aware of my intention? i will never let my men get too close to raise suspicions  
These assassins move us with this expeditious petition  
Quit trying to play this fucking game before i write your fucking name  
I'll hold the spade and tame a truck in rage, so don't be brave  

Intuition breeds pernicious and judicious  
Movements are repetitious, oh so vicious  
When i hit this, who's next? i'm prestigious with this secret coded text  
It's not a threat, i'm just letting you know  

If you don't back down, then i'll infect with this transmission  
All who listen get conscripted, so addicted to this flow  
It's so consistent, every soul enlisted knows this prescription was predicted  
And decrypted long ago, so i'm finished digging ditches for you bitches  

Here's your hoe  
Yeah, what y'all think that mean in light of the covid-19  
Anyways, enjoy the rest of the mixtape please  
Have a nice day  Paste DistroKid-formatted lyrics here
