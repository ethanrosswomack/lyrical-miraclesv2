> Yeah, I'm at odds with the world, this fuckin' planet makes me sick  
It's the people and it's evil giving me this nervous tick  
If I try to keep it peaceful, these deceitful lunatics just fuck me up within their legal  
System penal bullshit, they say I'm a menace to  

Society just because they can, but once they label  
You as schizophrenic, no one gives a damn  
No one hears the words you say, cause drones  
Don't understand anything but the codes that their masters  

Programmed speak about the truth and they'll start this  
Abuse every voice will be silenced, you've got no  
Choice but to lose all this violence, it's implying, so keep quiet  
Don't move, they'll come and snatch you out your house and then put you on the news  

You had a standoff with the cops, the whole neighborhood was rocked  
It's a lie, but what the fuck can you do when you are locked inside a cage  
All your rage will never make them stop reputing pieces like Jesus  
And they'll put you on a cross, no one believes me when I say that fuckin' demons need to  

Pay what the fuck, just shut up, there's something  
Eatin' at your brain take your meds before the feds come and haul  
You away I love my government and I believe they're  
Keeping me safe that's all I hear these days, Lord give  

Me strength I pray that somebody hears the words in this  
Verse and grows ways, we need more souls to grow  
Bold and stop doing what they told, we need a generation  
Unafraid to make the matrix fold  

Yo, if full disclosure was a cheat, nobody'd know what to believe  
But as you can see, secret societies are trying to silence me  
I wonder why, cause if I die before my time, they'll just lie  
But everyone who hears my music knows I use it just to try to bring some light up in this  

World before this darkness breaks us down, I can  
Promise you this before I'm six feet in the ground, I'ma make  
This system bleed and take this frequency fence out  
And all my starseeds will just grow and overwhelm the whole crowd  

And all around will hear the sound and with this matrix offline, no more agents  
Or outrageous surveillance all the time, no more medicated mental patients  
Searching for them behind our dedications paying off perfect placement when I rhyme  
Because what I'm saying is that this world is gonna change  

I incarnated just to make sure it's rearranged  
I can't fail, I wish him well  
All those months up in that cell didn't weaken me  
They strengthened me, so I'm sending back to hell  

Every demon busy tweeting, giving me a reason to delete them  
Or to complete when they're defeated, till then I will just keep speaking  
All these songs are meant to creep in, and repeat until it sinks in  
Activations coded too deep for men to keep sleeping  

I can't fail, I wish him well  
All those months up in that cell didn't weaken

Mental Health as Control Mechanism — This track boldly challenges the use of diagnoses as social silencing. Once you’re labeled, you’re no longer heard. “Once they label you as schizophrenic, no one gives a damn.”

Criminalization of Consciousness — Hawk Eye draws a direct line between truth-speaking and persecution. From house raids to media spin, the lyrics highlight how the system neutralizes voices that awaken others.

Matrix Breaker Thesis — Tied to the mythology from Full Disclosure, this track aims to inspire a generation “unafraid to make the matrix fold.” It’s a call to spiritual insurrection disguised as a paranoid breakdown.

Martyr Echoes — Still reeling from Scripture and Whistleblower, this track adds institutional psychiatry and surveillance culture to the enemy roster — painting the artist as both fugitive and messiah figure.
