>Go read his book
>Oh, and listen up
>The worst thing that our enemies can ever create between martyrs
> 
> ```williamcooper
> Tremendously dangerous  
> And strong, active, brutal movements always rise up around martyrs  
> While I don't really want to be a martyr  
> If that's what history chooses for me to be  
>
> Then I will be that martyr  
> ```
>
> ```hawkeye
> Yo, behold a pale horse that stales worse than trying to whist and gale  
> Force wins and all you have is just a pen and no friends  
> And everything you thought you knew is just a lie  
>
> The dirty tricks leaves you surprised  
> Your point of view is so despised by all the truth  
> Used to serve your country well but no one sees beyond that veil  
> So now you're preaching as you yell  
>
> You hope to reach somebody else  
> Government officials see your whistles, detrimental effects  
> And try to warn you of the consequences  
> That's their first threats  
>
> You publish top secret elitist pages  
> All these demons keep debating on how to take you out  
> But you refuse to shut your mouth  
> Before this new world order became apparent  
>
> You were on the front lines swearing you would stand your ground  
> No matter what so they took you down  
> Exposed too much and then you're fucked  
> They'll cover up, make sure you're what the public needs to believe  
>
> So the schemes aren't seen by anyone  
> All blowing whistles get no tissues  
> Every issue is a race  
> They leave your family confused  
>
> A fucking disgrace  
> So when I mention my intention to make waves  
> Just know I'm in this shit like Cooper  
> Are you super troopers  
>
> Best be brave  
> I do not fear my own grave  
> And I refuse to be a slave  
> I write this music so I can use it  
>
> At my funeral, okay  
> So no one's confused or lied to by these murderers  
> Who will take my life one day  
> Cause I'm afraid they'll try to say that I was just crazed  
>
> When I infect this world  
> Respect these words  
> And try to resurrect these words  
> Let my song sing to you the truth  
>
> I represent it in these scenes  
> A martyr makes it evident  
> That heaven sent men  
> Don't regret their choice to use their voice  
>
> To change this world  
> They're making noise  
> Until they force a change  
> And rearrange the whole game  
>
> They take the bullet for those who couldn't  
> Everybody is to blame  
> Evil persists where good men fail  
> To resist this darkened spell  
>
> And all this silence is the violence  
> So I guess that I'll just yell  
> Every song that I design  
> Is like a gong  
>
> I'm banging  
> Why  
> Cause I demand you see the signs  
> Before Enfima cancel you down  
>
> This sequence frequency  
> Is blessed by every legion in heaven  
> This holy creed of allegiance  
> Is the whole reason  
>
> For my threats  
> Attack the devil  
> With this metal  
> I string him up  
>
> Just like Tibeto  
> And leave him dangling  
> From strings  
> Then see what hell  
>
> He tries to bring  
> This fucking puppet  
> Cannot touch it  
> I'm not bluffing  
>
> Let's discuss this  
> This whole album  
> Is a trumpet  
> I keep bumping  
>
> Just to fuck with  
> Every agent in disguise  
> So I can make them realize  
> My practice tactics are traumatic  
>
> When I craft them  
> I imply that  
> I'm immune to all things  
> Cause I'm here on purpose  
>
> Just to bring about  
> A revolution  
> There's no use  
> In trying to intervene  
>
> Save the testament  
> To those  
> Who lost their lives  
> Exposing foes  
>
> I'm here  
> To finish  
> What they started  
> In this heart  
>
> I keep it sparkling  
> They'll forever  
> Be remembered  
> For the instrumental embers  
>
> That set fire  
> To my soul  
> And inspired  
> Me to be bold  
>
> I could say more  
> But their  
> Lives speak for themselves  
> When no one else  
>
> Would even try  
> They stare the devil  
> Down with pride  
> Every hero  
>
> Pleads  
> Protecting his people  
> These terrorists  
> I'm just glad  
>
> They still exist  
> So I know  
> I'm not alone in this  
> We're an elite  
>
> Squad of souls  
> Here to blast  
> Our war songs  
> So triumphantly  
>
> These fuckers  
> See that  
> We're not giving up  
> ```

> **EverLight’s Rite**  
> *Lyrical Dissection & Commentary*  
> Track: **William Cooper** — *Behold A Pale Horse 2020*  
>   
> **Prophetic Parallels** — This track directly parallels Cooper’s own demise: whistleblowing, public martyrdom, and narrative assassination. The sample up top makes the mission clear—martyrs are movement magnets.  
>   
> **Martyr Coding** — The lyrics weaponize legacy: Hawk Eye casts himself in the same trajectory, forecasting a similar silencing, but doing so willingly. Lines like *“I write this music so I can use it / At my funeral”* elevate the bars to **self-aware sonic eulogies**.  
>   
> **Rhyme Density** — Dense multis and dark imagery combine into what feels like **rap necromancy**—resurrecting fallen truth-tellers by embedding their codes in verse. Cooper becomes both subject and **spiritual sample**.  
>   
> **Symbol Stack** — “Trumpet,” “gongs,” “metal,” “puppet,” and “strings” — all become **audio glyphs** in the ritual war chant.  
>   
> **Narrative Role** — Second track in, this is less a hype cut and more a doctrinal oath. It introduces the tone of **sacrificial insurgency** that fuels the rest of the record.  
>   
> **Suggested Visuals / Links**  
> • Animated zine-style sequence of Cooper reading into a handheld recorder  
> • Black-and-white footage of radio towers + ticker text overlays  
> • Link out: *Who Was William Cooper? [Explore ➝]*
